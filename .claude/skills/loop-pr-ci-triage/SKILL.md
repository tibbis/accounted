description: Proactive loop that watches open PRs in erp-mafia/accounted, fixes failing CI, and addresses actionable review-bot / reviewer comments, on the PR branch, never merging. Use on a session-local schedule (/loop) or on-demand via /loop-pr-ci-triage. Follows .claude/loops.md (propose-don't-merge, dedupe, loop-verify gate).

# loop-pr-ci-triage

**Goal:** every open, non-draft PR authored by our team or dependabot is either green + review-addressed,
or explicitly escalated with `loop:needs-human`. **Never merge.** Read `.claude/loops.md` first.

## Preflight
- `gh auth status` and confirm repo `erp-mafia/accounted`. If either fails, stop and report "environment not provisioned".
- Respect [foreign WIP](../../../CLAUDE.md): never touch a branch with another human's uncommitted/active work; never force-push over someone's commits.

## 1. Enumerate & prioritize
```bash
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,isDraft,headRefName,author,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup,updatedAt
```
Skip: drafts; PRs by `contributor:flagged`/`pr:flagged` authors; PRs already labeled `loop:needs-human`.
Prioritize (cap **5 PRs/run**, log the rest):
1. Failing CI that's a mechanical fix (lint, type error, snapshot, a flaky/needs-rerun check).
2. Dependabot bumps failing `core-only` / `pg-real` (there is a live backlog: #730, #639, #638, #637).
3. Unresolved actionable review comments (from "The PR Agent", Superagent, or a human).

## 2. Diagnose each PR
- Failing checks: read the failing job. `gh pr checks <n>`; open the failing run's log
  (`gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`). Identify the *specific* failing command from `core-build.yml` /
  `test-pg-real.yml` (e.g. `check:lint`, `npm test`, `test:pg`, the extension-import grep).
- Review comments: `gh pr view <n> --comments`. Separate *actionable* (a concrete bug/change) from
  informational. Follow the [bot-triage rule](../../../CLAUDE.md): honest triage beats chasing every finding.

## 3. Fix (propose-don't-merge)
- `gh pr checkout <n>` (or for dependabot, check out its branch). Reproduce the failure locally by
  running the exact failing command. Make the **minimal** fix.
- Run the **[`loop-verify`](../loop-verify/SKILL.md)** gate. If it can't pass safely → step 5.
- `git push` to the PR's own branch. Leave a concise comment on the PR: what was failing, what you
  changed, verify output. Do **not** `gh pr merge`.

## 4. Dependabot specifics
If a bump breaks the build/tests, the fix is usually a small code adaptation to the new API or a
peer-dep pin. If the bump is a **major** version with wide breakage, don't force it: comment with the
breaking changes found and label `loop:needs-human` instead of a risky rewrite.

## 5. Escalate / anti-thrash
If you already attempted the same fix on this PR (same failure signature) and it failed again, or the
fix is unsafe/large: **stop**, add label `loop:needs-human`, comment what you tried and why you stopped.
Never retry the same failing push in a cycle.

## 6. Report
Summarize per PR: fixed & pushed / commented / escalated / skipped (with reason). This summary is the
routine's completion notification.

## Batch mode (optional)
For many PRs at once, drive this with a dynamic **workflow**: one agent per PR in its own worktree
(`isolation: 'worktree'`) so parallel fixes don't collide, then an adversarial reviewer per fix before
it's pushed. Keep the 5-PR cap unless told otherwise.
