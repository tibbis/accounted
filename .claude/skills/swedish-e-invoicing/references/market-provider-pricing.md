## Qvalia public pricing (EUR, read from qvalia.com/pricing 2026-09-21)

| Plan | Monthly EUR | Messages/mo | API access |
|---|---|---|---|
| Connect Small | €9 | 25 | No |
| Connect Medium | €39 | 100 | Yes |
| Connect Large | €99 | 1,000 | Yes |
| Connect 1X | €299 | 5,000 | Yes |
| Connect 2X | €499 | 12,000 | Yes |
| Connect 3X | €899 | 30,000 | Yes |

Billed monthly, no setup fee listed. Messages beyond the plan cost €1 each (Small to Large) or €0.50 each (1X to 3X), billed in arrears. The multi-tenant Partner API is priced by agreement, not on the public page. **Most transparent commercial pricing in the Swedish market**, useful as a benchmark.

The April 2026 version of this table was wrong on the upper tiers (it listed €499 for 5,000 and €899 for 10,000+ messages, less than half the real volumes) and listed a free tier that is not on the pricing page.

API note (2026-09): Qvalia's Partner API now documents HMAC-signed webhooks with replay protection, an idempotency key on submission, and terminal versus non-terminal delivery statuses. Details and sources in `docs/PEPPOL_FOUNDATION.md` ("Qvalia API update").

## SME pricing benchmarks (April 2026)

| Item | Typical SME price (SEK) |
|---|---|
| Outbound e-invoice (sender) | **3.00-3.50** (Bokio, SpeedLedger, BL); 0-3.40 (InExchange) |
| Inbound e-invoice | Often free; 3.50 (BL) |
| Monthly minimum (SME platform) | 0-199 |
| Setup/onboarding | 0 |
| Postal fallback | 8.25-20 |
| Kivra to consumer | ~5 |
| Enterprise (Pagero/Basware) per-doc | Negotiated, EUR 0.10-0.50 |

## How Swedish accounting platforms wire Peppol

**The dominant SME accounting platforms in Sweden all white-label two intermediaries.** Fortnox, Bokio and SpeedLedger funnel through **Crediflow**. Visma eEkonomi/SPCS/Administration/Business funnel through **Visma Autoinvoice (Maventa)**, which is itself a certified Peppol AP. None operate their own Peppol AP, except Hogia.

This concentration is a strategic opening for any new platform: **building native Peppol disintermediates the entire value chain** and removes a markup baked into incumbent pricing.

### Fortnox

- Sweden's largest cloud ERP (~500,000+ customers).
- REST API at `https://api.fortnox.se/3/` (XML or JSON).
- Rate limit 25 req/5s/token.
- OAuth2 via `https://apps.fortnox.se/oauth-v1/`.
- Key endpoints: `/3/invoices`, `/3/supplierinvoices`, `/3/supplierinvoicepayments`, `/3/invoicepayments`, `/3/supplierinvoicefileconnections` (attach UBL/PDF), `/3/supplierinvoiceaccruals`, `/3/customers`, `/3/suppliers`, `/3/articles`, `/3/vouchers`, `/3/accounts`, `/3/financialyears`, `/3/taxreductions` (ROT/RUT), `/3/noxfinansinvoices` (factoring).
- WebSocket push API delivers `Invoices`/`SupplierInvoices`/`Vouchers`/`Customers` topics.
- Peppol-ID auto-published in Peppol Directory for AB customers.
- ROT/RUT housework supported natively (`HouseWork=true`, `HouseWorkType`, `HouseWorkHoursToReport`).

### Visma Autoinvoice / Maventa

- Cleanest Peppol developer story among Swedish platforms.
- API docs: https://documentation.autoinvoice.visma.com/
- REST and legacy SOAP, OAuth2 client-credentials.
- Operator routing flags: `PEPPOL`, `INEXCHANGE`, `NEMHANDEL`, `SCAN`, `BANK`, `B2CSE`, `VISMASCANNER`.
- The `lookup`/`finder` endpoint exposes SMP discovery.
- `POST /v1/services/b2cse/agreement` registers a sender on the Swedish bank-based B2C rail (e-faktura privat).

### Bokio

- Outbound UBL Peppol BIS Billing 3 at **3 SEK per invoice** via Crediflow.
- **B2B only** for outbound Peppol.
- Auto-flags year-end-crossing invoices.
- Provides "Konvertera till fakturametoden" UX, useful template for any Swedish bookkeeping product.

### Björn Lundén (BL Total / Lundify)

- **3.50 SEK per outbound and inbound** e-invoice.

### SpeedLedger

- Bank-feed centric.
- **3 SEK per sent**.

### Hogia

- The only major SE accounting vendor with its own Peppol AP.
- Owns relationships with several mid-market customers.

## Industry consolidation post-2022

Pattern: **bigger players are bundling tax + invoicing + AP automation + compliance reporting for enterprise**, leaving the Swedish SME and redovisningsbyrå segment as fertile ground.

| Year | Event |
|---|---|
| 2022 | Basware take-private by Accel-KKR + Long Path + Briarwood, €620M, 94.7% premium |
| Feb 2024 | Thomson Reuters acquires Pagero, ~SEK 8.1B / USD 800M |
| 2024 | VIA Equity acquires Crediflow group |
| 1 Jul 2024 | GEP (US) acquires OpusCapita from PSG Equity |
| ~2020 | Visma Group acquires InExchange (Factorum AB) |
| 2019-2020 | Ropo Capital acquires Colligent Inkasso, Posti Messaging Scandinavia |

**Reseller dependency risk is now real**, Pagero is a TR division, Basware is PE-owned, both will eventually re-price upward. Build optionality into the stack via a clean `SendClient` abstraction with dual-vendor capability.

## Choosing an Access Point partner, decision framework

For a new Swedish accounting/fintech product, the practical menu:

1. **Storecove**, best DX, single API across Peppol + IT SDI + FR PA + PL KSeF + BE + DE. Free 30-day sandbox. Effective rate €0.05-€0.30/invoice. **Best fit when multi-mandate is needed.**
2. **Qvalia**, transparent EUR pricing, ISO 27001, Swedish-headquartered, partner and multi-tenant API. Since September 2026 the API documents signed webhooks, idempotent submission and a defined status lifecycle, which closes most of the DX gap to Storecove for Peppol-only flows. Accounted's contracted Access Point.
3. **InExchange**, heaviest Swedish installed base, but partial vendor lock-in via Visma Group ownership.
4. **Visma Autoinvoice / Maventa**, only worth it if already integrating Visma ecosystem.
5. **Pagero / Basware**, enterprise-only, not SME-friendly post-acquisition.
6. **Own Oxalis-NG AP**, only for receive at low volume (€100/mo Hetzner + €4,400 yr-1 OpenPeppol fees). For send, only economic above ~25k invoices/month.

**Build vs buy break-even:** reseller cost of ~€0.10/invoice (mid-volume Storecove) versus own-AP fixed cost of ~€30k/year (membership + cert + ops) breaks even at **~300,000 invoices/year sent through your customers**, equivalent to ~3,000-5,000 active SME customers each sending 50-100 invoices/month. **For receive there is no economic case to build initially**, Storecove free receive or own Oxalis on a small VPS dominate.
