-- Community publishing through the public repository erp-mafia/accounted-skills
-- (community/<slug>/SKILL.md, MIT). Accounted reviews a shared own item in the
-- app and opens it there as a pull request; an hourly sync
-- (src/lib/agent-skills/community-sync.ts) upserts merged files as tier
-- 'community' atoms. Nothing is exposed to an AI until an Accounted reviewer
-- approved that exact text (company_skills.approved_body_sha, or
-- trigger_signals.approved_sha on the atom): the repository is public and a
-- push to main is not a review. Items contributed straight on GitHub have no
-- submission row, so their kind, author and industries travel on the atom
-- (trigger_signals) and community_item_stats() falls back to them.

-- 1. Review evidence, set by Accounted only, never by the author:
--    review_note: why a submission was sent back (it returns to 'private' so
--      the author can fix it and share again);
--    approved_body_sha: the SHA-256 of the exact SKILL.md the reviewer approved
--      when opening it as a pull request; a merged file with another hash
--      (edited on GitHub after review) waits for a new approval.
