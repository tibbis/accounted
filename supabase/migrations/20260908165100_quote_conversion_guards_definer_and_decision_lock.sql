-- Follow-up to 20260908165000_quote_source_conversion_guards (issue #2224).
--
-- 1. The two source guards run their SELECT ... FOR UPDATE on the quote row
--    as the invoker. Under RLS a FOR UPDATE also applies the UPDATE policy,
--    and invoices_update requires the row's company to be the caller's
--    ACTIVE company. A member of several companies writing through raw
--    PostgREST for a non-active company therefore got zero rows back: no
--    lock, v_source_type NULL, guard skipped. SECURITY DEFINER makes the
--    lookup see the row regardless (the guards read document_type and
--    liveness only; they grant nothing). Because a definer lookup sees every
--    company's rows, both guards now also require the source document to
--    belong to the same company as the row being written: a foreign
--    source_invoice_id / converted_from_id is refused outright instead of
--    locking and inspecting another tenant's quote.
-- 2. A quote with a live kundorder is the customer's accepted agreement
--    behind that order. The decision guard only knew converted invoices, so
--    the quote could still be moved to open or declined while the order was
--    being delivered and invoiced. It now also refuses leaving 'accepted'
--    while a live kundorder points at the quote, raising the registry code
--    the decision writers map to 409 INVOICE_QUOTE_ALREADY_ORDERED. Same
--    definer treatment for the same reason.
