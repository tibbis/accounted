-- One QR code per invoice, chosen automatically.
--
-- The invoice PDF used to stack up to three payment QR codes (Swish, the
-- payment link and the bank-app UsingQR code), each behind its own switch.
-- It now prints at most one, decided by a mode:
--
--   auto          Swish for a private customer when Swish is usable, else the
--                 bank-app QR when it is usable, else Swish, else the
--                 payment-link QR when the invoice has a link, else none.
--   bank_app      the bank-app QR (UsingQR), or none when it is unusable
--   swish         the Swish QR, or none when it is unusable
--   payment_link  the payment-link QR, or none when the invoice has no link
--   none          no QR code
--
-- An explicit mode never falls back to another code: the invoice prints none
-- and the editor says why (lib/invoices/payment-qr.ts).
--
-- company_settings.invoice_qr_mode is the company default. invoices.qr_mode
-- overrides it for one invoice; NULL inherits the company default.
--
-- ADD COLUMN with a constant DEFAULT fills every existing row without an
-- UPDATE (an UPDATE on company_settings would trip
-- block_migration_reset_source_mutation on reset-source rows).
