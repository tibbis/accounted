-- Atomic API-key creation and allowlist replacement.
-- pg-test: tests/pg/api-key-allowlist-atomic.pg.test.ts
--
-- Finding (security scan on the per-key company allowlist, PR #2753): the
-- allowlist writes were not atomic with key creation or with allowlist
-- replacement. The OAuth token endpoint and the settings key-creation route
-- inserted the api_keys row, then the api_key_companies rows, and revoked the
-- key when the second insert failed. The settings PATCH route replaced an
-- allowlist by upserting the new rows and then deleting the rest. Each of
-- those is two PostgREST requests, so a failure (or a crash) between them
-- leaves the wrong state behind:
--   create:  a key with no allowlist rows, which by the table's semantics
--            reaches EVERY company its user belongs to, wider than consented;
--            the compensating revoke is itself a request that can fail;
--   replace: the union of the old and the new set, wider than either.
--
-- Why an RPC: PostgREST runs one statement per request, so two table writes
-- cannot share a transaction from the application, and a compensating write
-- is not a transaction. A plpgsql function body is one transaction: either
-- the key row and its allowlist rows both exist, or neither does; either the
-- new set replaced the old one, or the old one is untouched.
--
-- Both functions are SECURITY DEFINER and service_role only, like
-- validate_and_increment_api_key (20260928112721) and rotate_mcp_refresh_token
-- (20260902090000 section 3): api_key_companies has no policies and the
-- routes that call these already run the service client. The membership rule
-- the routes pre-check (every allowed company is a live membership of the
-- key's user) is repeated inside as the backstop; a key that reaches a
-- company its user cannot is refused here whatever the caller sent. The
-- admin gate the api_keys_insert policy enforced for JWT sessions is NOT
-- repeated here: the OAuth token endpoint mints role-capped keys for every
-- role (a viewer gets a read-only key), so create_api_key_with_allowlist
-- takes any user; the settings route keeps its owner/admin check in code.

-- 1. create_api_key_with_allowlist ------------------------------------------
--
-- Inserts the api_keys row and, for a restricted key, one api_key_companies
-- row per allowed company, in one transaction. Returns the new key id.
--
-- p_company_ids NULL or empty: unrestricted (no allowlist rows). Otherwise
-- every id must be a non-archived company the user is a live member of, and
-- p_company_id (the key's default company) must be one of them: a default
-- outside the allowlist would be a key that reaches more than consented.
-- Duplicates collapse; first-occurrence order is kept for the inserts.
--
-- p_name and p_mode NULL take the column defaults ('Unnamed key', 'live');
-- rate_limit_rpm and request_count are never passed and keep theirs. The
-- sod_acknowledged_at / sod_acknowledged_by pair is passed through as given
-- and checked by api_keys_sod_ack_paired.

-- 2. replace_api_key_allowlist -----------------------------------------------
--
-- Replaces a key's allowlist as a set, in one transaction: rows outside the
-- new list are deleted and missing ones inserted, so the key is never at the
-- union of old and new. p_company_ids NULL or empty deletes every row (the
-- key becomes unrestricted). Returns the number of allowlist rows the key has
-- after the call.
--
-- The key row is locked FOR UPDATE for the duration so two concurrent
-- replacements serialise. A key that does not exist or is revoked raises:
-- editing a revoked key's reach reads as re-enabling it, and it does not.
-- Membership is validated against the key's own user (api_keys.user_id),
-- never against the caller: the caller is the service role.
