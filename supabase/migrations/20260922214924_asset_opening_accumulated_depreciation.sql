-- Migration: opening accumulated depreciation on the asset register
--
-- Why this exists: a company moving to Accounted from another system brings
-- assets that are already partly depreciated. The ledger side arrives through
-- the SIE import (the 12x9 ackumulerade avskrivningar balance), but the
-- register row only knew acquisition date, cost and useful life, so the
-- depreciation engine counted only depreciation booked in Accounted. Book
-- value, the next depreciation proposal and the disposal gain/loss were then
-- wrong. BFNAR 2013:2 punkt 4.5 requires the register to carry the
-- ackumulerade avskrivningar per asset.
--
-- Two columns: the amount already depreciated before Accounted, and the date
-- it is stated per. Registering it NEVER posts a voucher: the amount is
-- already in the imported ledger. The engine reads it as depreciation on the
-- books through that date and plans the rest from there.
--
-- RLS: unchanged. The columns live on public.assets, whose company-scoped
-- policies (user_company_ids()) already cover every column.
--
-- Trigger: enforce_asset_post_disposal_immutability is redefined (same body
-- as 20260803226000_atomic_asset_disposal.sql plus the two new columns) so a
-- disposed asset's opening balance is frozen like its other financial
-- attributes.
--
-- pg-test: covered-by tests/pg/assets.pg.test.ts
