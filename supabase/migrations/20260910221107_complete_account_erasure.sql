-- Complete account erasure: every personal-data store of a deleted user.
--
-- WHY
-- ---
-- Accounted never deletes auth.users. Account deletion is
-- app/api/account/delete/route.ts -> anonymize_user_account plus a ~100-year
-- ban, which keeps the auth row as a tombstone so BFL-retained bookkeeping
-- keeps its foreign keys. No `REFERENCES auth.users ON DELETE CASCADE` in the
-- schema therefore ever fires, and cleanup reaches only the tables the RPC
-- names. Migration 20260803090000 added the WhatsApp channel to that list.
-- This migration covers the rest: user-scoped tables added since (BankID
-- company roles, bank and mail consents, Skatteverket tokens, assistant
-- conversations, per-user settings and operational state), GoTrue's own rows
-- (sessions, refresh tokens, identities, MFA factors) and the email address on
-- the tombstone. The route's auth.admin.signOut() call could not end sessions
-- (it expects a JWT, not a user id), so sessions are ended here as well.
--
-- WHAT
-- ----
-- 1. public.erase_user_personal_data(uuid) is the one definition of erasure.
--    anonymize_user_account calls it after its guards, and the repair pass at
--    the bottom calls it for every existing tombstone, so an old tombstone
--    ends in exactly the state a new deletion produces. It has no auth.uid()
--    check of its own: SECURITY INVOKER, and EXECUTE revoked from everyone
--    but its owner, so it only runs inside anonymize_user_account (SECURITY
--    DEFINER) or as the migration role.
-- 2. Deleted: user-scoped state with no retention basis. Memberships, API
--    keys, OAuth client registrations and flows, one-time codes, calendar feed
--    tokens, Skatteverket tokens, BankID identity and enrichment, preferences,
--    notification settings and log, push subscriptions, notice dismissals,
--    pending email changes, extension toggles, idempotency keys, MCP tasks,
--    rate counters, sandbox seed locks, chat and assistant conversations
--    (agent_messages cascade).
-- 3. Revoked in place: bank_connections and mail_connections. Transactions,
--    cash_accounts and imported underlag reference those rows, so they stay;
--    the consent was the erased person's, so what made it usable is shredded
--    and status becomes 'revoked' (the bank sync and the mail search read only
--    status = 'active'). That includes an archived migration-reset source
--    company: block_migration_reset_source_mutation keeps its records
--    unchanged and now lets exactly one change through on bank_connections,
--    the revoke that shreds the consent (status 'revoked', credentials and
--    accounts_data NULL, the rest of the row identical). A consent is not an
--    accounting record, and an erased user must not keep one anywhere.
-- 4. Retained: company-owned records, above all bookkeeping under BFL 7 kap.
--    2 § and its processing history. They point at the tombstone id and carry
--    no personal data of the erased user. tests/pg/account-erasure.pg.test.ts
--    classifies every foreign key to auth.users and fails on one that is not
--    classified, which is what keeps this class of gap from coming back.
-- 5. auth: refresh tokens, sessions, MFA factors, flow state, one-time tokens
--    and identities are deleted, and the email is cleared. GoTrue creates
--    several of those tables at startup rather than the database image, so
--    they are reached through to_regclass-guarded dynamic SQL and the function
--    works on a database without them (pg-real CI, a self-hosted database
--    before GoTrue's first boot). Identities go BEFORE the email is cleared:
--    unlink_old_address_identities (BEFORE UPDATE OF email) would otherwise
--    re-insert an email identity for the tombstone and write the erased
--    address into auth.audit_log_entries.
--
-- Clearing the email ends the re-signup block the tombstone used to give: the
-- same address can now register a new, empty account. That is a product
-- preference, not a retention basis; see DECISIONS.md 2026-09-10.

-- Migration-reset source companies are retention containers (20260818084050):
-- their rows stay unchanged. The one change let through is revoking a bank
-- consent, once (a repeat would still bump updated_at), which alters no
-- accounting-shaped data and is what erasure needs (header, point 3). The IFs are nested because NEW.session_id only exists on
-- bank_connections and AND gives no evaluation-order guarantee.
