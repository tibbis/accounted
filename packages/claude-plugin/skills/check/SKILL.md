# Check

A read-only pass over the books that ends in a short prioritized list. This flow never writes anything; it routes each finding to the flow that fixes it.

## Flow

1. If not already done this session, call `accounted_get_agent_briefing`.
2. Read `Accounted://attention`, `Accounted://period/active`, and `Accounted://recent-activity`.
3. Assess, in this order:
   - Unbooked backlog: how many items, how old is the oldest?
   - Unreconciled bank transactions in the active period.
   - Overdue customer invoices and unpaid supplier invoices.
   - Unapproved pending operations waiting on the user (`accounted_list_pending_operations`).
   - Upcoming deadlines: moms, AGI, F-skatt, bokslut. Use dates from the product, not memorized ones.
   - Period status: is a period that should be closed still open?
4. Present a short table in the user's language: finding, severity, and which flow fixes it (`/accounted:bookkeep`, `/accounted:month-close`, `/accounted:vat`, `/accounted:payroll`, `/accounted:year-end`).
5. If everything is clean, say so plainly and state the next deadline.

## Rules

- Strictly read-only: do not stage or approve anything in this flow, even if the fix is obvious. Offer the fixing flow instead.
- Report only what the data shows; no speculative findings.
- Company context: if the working directory (or a parent, nearest wins) contains `.accounted.json` with `{ "company_id": "<uuid>", "name": "<name>" }`, pass that `company_id` on every company-scoped call and say the company name once at the start. Otherwise, if `accounted_list_companies` is among your tools, the account reaches several companies: call it and ask once which company the task concerns (or whether it spans all of them) before any write, never write to a company the user did not name, and read back the `company: { company_id, name, is_default }` block that opens every result whenever it is not the company they named. If `accounted_list_companies` is not among your tools, the account has one company: results carry no company block and none of this applies.
