# accounted-mcp

Connect Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or another stdio MCP client to your
[Accounted](https://app.accounted.se) bookkeeping account.

This zero-dependency bridge forwards JSON-RPC over stdio to the hosted Accounted
MCP server. New connections receive the `accounted_*` tool namespace. Existing
`gnubok-mcp` configurations remain supported separately.

## Setup

1. Create an API key in Accounted under **Settings > API**.
2. Add the bridge to your MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "accounted": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "accounted-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ACCOUNTED_API_KEY": "gnubok_sk_test_...",
        "ACCOUNTED_CLIENT": "claude-desktop"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The credential value retains the legacy `gnubok_sk_*` wire prefix for backward
compatibility. Only the MCP integration is being renamed in this release.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `ACCOUNTED_API_KEY` | yes | none | Your existing Accounted API key. |
| `ACCOUNTED_URL` | no | Accounted hosted MCP endpoint | Override for self-hosted Accounted. The bridge adds `tool_namespace=accounted` when omitted. |
| `ACCOUNTED_CLIENT` | no | none | Telemetry-only distribution marker such as `claude-desktop`. |
| `ACCOUNTED_COMPANY` | no | none | Company id (UUID) that pins the connection to one company: the company switch is hidden and every call runs for that company. A value that is not a UUID stops the bridge instead of falling back to the key default. |

The API key scopes determine which tools are visible and callable. Write tools
stage pending operations for explicit approval before anything is booked.

A key reaches every company its user belongs to, or only the companies it was
limited to when it was created; `ACCOUNTED_COMPANY` (the `?company=<id>` query
parameter on the endpoint URL for OAuth connectors) narrows one connection
further, to a single company.

## OAuth connector (no API key, no account needed up front)

Clients with OAuth support connect directly without this bridge and without an
existing API key. The sign-in screen lets a new user create the Accounted
account (BankID or e-mail), and company setup then continues in the
conversation through the `onboarding` skill and `accounted_create_company`:

```text
https://app.accounted.se/api/extensions/ext/mcp-server/mcp?tool_namespace=accounted
```

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add --transport http accounted \
  "https://app.accounted.se/api/extensions/ext/mcp-server/mcp?tool_namespace=accounted"

# OpenAI Codex
codex mcp add accounted --url \
  "https://app.accounted.se/api/extensions/ext/mcp-server/mcp?tool_namespace=accounted"
```

Claude.ai and Claude Desktop: Settings > Connectors > Add custom connector,
paste the URL, then in step 2 choose:

- **Authentication: "Required when the server asks."** Claude auto-detects
  "None" because the server answers the handshake without credentials; with
  "None" the first company-scoped call shows an error instead of the sign-in.
- **OAuth client: "No client ID, register one automatically" (DCR).** The
  server does not advertise Anthropic's hosted client metadata (CIMD) yet.
- No additional headers; transport stays Streamable HTTP.

The connector works before you connect (documentation tools); the first
company-scoped call opens the sign-in prompt, where a new user creates the
account.

## Compatibility

The legacy `gnubok-mcp` package, environment variables, endpoint behavior, and
`gnubok_*` tool aliases remain supported. Existing installations do not need to
change.

## Releasing

The package is published to npm by the `Publish packages to npm` workflow
(`.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml`), never by hand:

1. Bump `version` in `packages/accounted-mcp/package.json`.
2. Merge the change to `main`.
3. The workflow compares the new version with the registry and, if it is not
   there yet, runs `npm publish --provenance --access public`. A version that
   already exists on npm is skipped, so other `package.json` edits are harmless.

The workflow needs the repository secret `NPM_TOKEN`: an npm granular access
token with read and write access to `accounted-mcp`, `gnubok-mcp` and
`accounted`, with two-factor bypass enabled so CI can publish. npm caps the
lifetime of such tokens (90 days at the time of writing), so rotate the secret
before it lapses. Without the secret the run fails at its first step. The
workflow can also be started from the Actions tab, for one package or all, with
a dry-run option that packs and validates without publishing.

## Gather what is missing

Accounted's nightly check lists documents the bookkeeping expects but the archive lacks, as the resource `Accounted://arkiv/missing`. The skill in `skills/accounted-gather/SKILL.md` of the Accounted repository tells an assistant how to find those documents in the mail and drives it already has access to, upload them with the person's approval, and close each item with `gnubok_resolve_missing`. Install it as a custom skill in claude.ai or Claude Code next to this bridge.
