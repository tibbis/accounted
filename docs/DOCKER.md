# Self-Hosting Accounted with Docker

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose (v2)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project (free tier works)

You do **not** need Node.js, npm, or anything else installed locally. The pre-built image has everything.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Download the required files

```bash
mkdir Accounted && cd Accounted

# Compose file + env template
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erp-mafia/accounted/main/docker-compose.yml

# Env template + cron sidecar (Dockerfile + schedule)
mkdir -p docker
curl -fsSL -o docker/.env.example \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erp-mafia/accounted/main/docker/.env.example
curl -fsSL -o docker/cron.Dockerfile \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erp-mafia/accounted/main/docker/cron.Dockerfile
curl -fsSL -o docker/crontab.self-hosted \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erp-mafia/accounted/main/docker/crontab.self-hosted
```

### 2. Configure your environment

```bash
cp docker/.env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in the **required** values:

| Variable | Where to find it |
|----------|-----------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase dashboard → Settings → API → Project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase dashboard → Settings → API → `anon` `public` key |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Supabase dashboard → Settings → API → `service_role` key |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | The URL where you'll access Accounted (e.g. `https://gnubok.example.com`) |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Any random string: `openssl rand -hex 32` works |

Once `.env` is filled in, **restrict its permissions** so other users on the host can't read your service-role key or cron secret:

```bash
chmod 600 .env
```

### 3. Start

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The app is now reachable on **loopback only** at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. This is intentional: direct internet exposure over HTTP is not safe for an accounting app. The next section enables HTTPS.

### 4. Verify

```bash
# Should return {"status":"healthy",...}
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

## Synology DSM and Xpenology

Use a **Container Manager Project**, not the single-container wizard. The
project path is the working directory for every relative path in the Compose
file. Create that directory first and put all of these files in it before
deploying the project:

```text
docker-compose.yml
.env
docker/
  cron.Dockerfile
  crontab.self-hosted
```

Uploading only `docker-compose.yml` is not enough: the cron service is built
from `docker/cron.Dockerfile` and bind-mounts
`docker/crontab.self-hosted`. Keep `.env` readable only by the administrator
and Container Manager because it contains the Supabase service-role key.

Container Manager ships its own Compose build, and supported keys vary by DSM
release. Accounted's base Compose file avoids the optional `cpus` and
`healthcheck.start_interval` keys for compatibility. Set a CPU limit through
Container Manager's resource controls or a local override if needed. When
updating an existing deployment that relied on the previous two-CPU cap,
reapply that limit in the host controls before restarting the project.

If you run Docker Compose 2.20.2 or newer against Docker Engine 25.0 or newer,
the optional resource overlay restores the previous two-CPU cap and faster
startup health checks while keeping the base file compatible. Download the
overlay from the same Accounted tag or full commit as the base Compose file:

```bash
ACCOUNTED_REF=replace-with-the-same-tag-or-full-commit
mkdir -p docker
curl -fsSLo docker/compose.resources.yml \
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erp-mafia/accounted/${ACCOUNTED_REF}/docker/compose.resources.yml"
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker/compose.resources.yml up -d
```

Compose only applies the files named in each invocation. Keep the resource
overlay in every later `up` command, after any other overlay. For example:

```bash
# HTTPS with Caddy
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker/compose.caddy.yml -f docker/compose.resources.yml up -d

# Local image build
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker/compose.build.yml -f docker/compose.resources.yml up --build -d
```

Do not use this overlay if Container Manager rejects either key or the Docker
Engine is older than 25.0. The memory and PID limits remain active in the base
file either way.

Accounted itself does not use PostgreSQL port 5432 and does not need a database
data folder when connected to Supabase Cloud. If Supabase is also running on
the NAS, follow the [fully self-hosted notes](SELF-HOSTING.md#synology-dsm-and-xpenology-notes)
for its separate project, bind mounts, ports, and JWKS configuration.

---

## Enable HTTPS (recommended)

Ship a Caddy reverse proxy alongside the app: it auto-provisions Let's Encrypt certificates and renews them forever.

### 1. Point a domain at the host

`gnubok.example.com → <your-public-ip>` (A record). Ports 80 and 443 must be reachable from the internet (Let's Encrypt's HTTP-01 challenge uses port 80).

### 2. Set `DOMAIN` in `.env`

```env
DOMAIN=gnubok.example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://gnubok.example.com
```

### 3. Download the overlay + Caddyfile

```bash
mkdir -p docker
curl -fsSL -o docker/compose.caddy.yml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erp-mafia/accounted/main/docker/compose.caddy.yml
curl -fsSL -o docker/Caddyfile \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erp-mafia/accounted/main/docker/Caddyfile
```

### 4. Start with the overlay

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker/compose.caddy.yml up -d
```

Caddy obtains a cert on first boot (takes ~10 s). Visit `https://gnubok.example.com`.

If you already have nginx / a managed load balancer / Cloudflare in front, skip Caddy and point your existing proxy at `127.0.0.1:3000`: set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to match the public URL.

## Optional Extensions

The self-hosted image ships with a curated set of general extensions, including email, invoice inbox, document extraction, push notifications, calendar, and the MCP server. Enable Banking and Skatteverket are in the preset too: they run on a connector key or on your own credentials (see [SELF-HOSTING.md](SELF-HOSTING.md), "Connector subscription"). Each extension activates when you provide its env vars: without them, the app works normally and the feature is simply unavailable.

### AI Features (document-extraction, invoice-inbox, AI assistant)

All AI runs Claude. Provide either a direct Anthropic API key:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

or AWS credentials with Bedrock model access to Claude, which keeps inference in eu-north-1:

```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
AWS_REGION=eu-north-1
```

If both are set, Bedrock is used; `AI_PROVIDER=bedrock|anthropic` forces the choice. `OPENAI_API_KEY` from earlier versions is not read by any code path. See [SELF-HOSTING.md](./SELF-HOSTING.md#ai-features) for optional model overrides.

The stock self-hosted image includes both `invoice-inbox` and
`document-extraction`, so the same provider credentials cover emailed invoices
and documents uploaded in the app.

### Email (invoice sending, reminders)

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=faktura@your-domain.com
RESEND_DELIVERY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

Invitations do not need Resend: the accept link is returned to the inviter in the app. See [SELF-HOSTING.md](./SELF-HOSTING.md#email-invoice-sending-invitations-and-reminders).

### Push Notifications

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=...
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=...
VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:you@example.com
```

Generate VAPID keys with: `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys`

### Calendar

No env vars needed: always available.

## Updating

The default `IMAGE_TAG=latest` follows `main` and updates on every `docker compose pull`. For production, **pin to a specific build** so updates are deliberate. Every merge to `main` publishes the image under two tags: `latest` and the bare 7-character commit SHA (for example `3e4b5dd`), so a pin looks like:

```env
# .env
IMAGE_TAG=3e4b5dd
```

Browse available tags at https://github.com/erp-mafia/accounted/pkgs/container/gnubok (the image name keeps the historical `gnubok` package name on purpose). For maximum integrity, pin by digest; the digest is printed in the `docker-publish` workflow run and by `docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/erp-mafia/gnubok:<sha>`:

```env
IMAGE_TAG=3e4b5dd@sha256:abcdef...
```

Semver tags (`1.2.3`, `1.2`, `1`) are published only when a `v*.*.*` git tag is cut. No such tag exists yet, so until the first tagged release the commit SHA is the only immutable pin.

Apply updates, refreshing the compose file as well: `docker compose pull`
updates only the image, and `docker-compose.yml` sometimes has to change with it
(a compose file from before [#3164](https://github.com/erp-mafia/accounted/issues/3164)
mounts `/app/.next` as a 400 MB tmpfs that newer images no longer fit in; the
container then stops at start with an error saying so). Keep local changes in a
`docker-compose.override.yml` so the download never overwrites them.

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erp-mafia/accounted/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

The cron sidecar is a small Alpine image built locally: it rebuilds automatically on `up --build` if you re-download `docker/cron.Dockerfile`. Base-image digests (node, alpine, caddy) are pinned in source and bumped manually when upstream ships security updates.

---

## Building from Source

If you prefer to build locally instead of pulling the pre-built image:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/erp-mafia/accounted.git
cd accounted
cp docker/.env.example .env
# Fill in .env

# Build and start
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker/compose.build.yml up --build -d
```

---

## Architecture

The compose setup runs two containers:

| Container | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| `app` | Next.js application server |
| `cron` | Lightweight Alpine sidecar that runs scheduled jobs (deadline checks, invoice reminders, tax deadline sync, document verification) via [supercronic](https://github.com/aptible/supercronic) |

The cron container waits for the app's healthcheck to pass before starting. It calls the app's cron API endpoints over the internal Docker network.

### How NEXT_PUBLIC_* injection works

The image is built with placeholder values (e.g. `__NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL__`) baked into the JavaScript bundles. The container's root filesystem is read-only, so at every start `docker-entrypoint.sh`, running unprivileged as `nextjs`, empties the writable mounts, copies the bundle from the image into them (`/app/.next` is the `next_runtime` named volume, `/app/public` a small tmpfs), `sed`-substitutes the placeholders with your runtime env vars, and removes the write bits from the served files before exec'ing Node. The volume holds nothing but that copy, so it needs no backup. It is a volume rather than a tmpfs because the bundle outgrew any fixed tmpfs size, and tmpfs pages count against the container's memory limit ([#3164](https://github.com/erp-mafia/accounted/issues/3164)).

---

## Ports

The app listens on port 3000 inside the container. The base compose binds it to `127.0.0.1:3000` on the host: change `PORT` in `.env` to remap. To expose on all interfaces (only do this if you're putting your own reverse proxy in front), override the port binding in a local `docker-compose.override.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    ports: !override
      - "${PORT:-3000}:3000"
```

---

## Reverse Proxy

The preferred path is the bundled Caddy overlay: see [Enable HTTPS](#enable-https-recommended). If you already run nginx, Traefik, or sit behind Cloudflare, leave the app on `127.0.0.1:3000` and point your existing proxy at it. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to the public URL.

Example nginx upstream:

```nginx
server {
    server_name gnubok.example.com;
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    # ssl_certificate / ssl_certificate_key / etc.

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**Container exits immediately**
```bash
docker compose logs app
```
Most common cause: missing required env vars. Check that all 5 required values in `.env` are set.

**Health check fails**
```bash
curl -v http://localhost:3000/api/health
```
The health endpoint tests database connectivity. If it returns `unhealthy`, verify your Supabase URL and service role key are correct.

**Cron container keeps restarting**
```bash
docker compose logs cron
```
The cron container depends on the app being healthy first. If the app never becomes healthy, the cron container will wait indefinitely.

**Port already in use**
Set a different port: `PORT=8080 docker compose up -d`
