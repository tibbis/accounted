/**
 * What a conversation is anchored to, as a chip.
 *
 * `agent_conversations.context_ref` has been written since the first intents
 * shipped. The panel ignored it entirely, and /chat printed it raw, so a
 * resumed thread's subtitle read "invoice:5f3a-9c21-...": a database
 * identifier shown to an accountant. Both surfaces now render the same chip,
 * which names the thing and links to it.
 *
 * Kind-agnostic on purpose (plan seam 8.4): the mapping lives in
 * route-mapping.ts, so teaching every surface about a new ref kind is one
 * entry in that map and no component change. A kind the map does not know
 * yet, a flow run for instance, renders nothing rather than a broken link.
