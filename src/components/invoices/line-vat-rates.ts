/**
 * The invoice editor's per-line Moms picker derives FOUR different behaviours
 * from the customer's VAT rules, and they must not share one set of rates:
 *
 *   - which options are RENDERED   → getPermittedVatRates() (the lawful set)
 *   - what a new line STARTS on    → getAvailableVatRates() (the default)
 *   - whether an article's rate is ADOPTED → the default set
 *   - what a customer switch SNAPS to     → the default
 *
 * Under huvudregeln (ML 6 kap. 34 §, Article 44 VAT Directive) a B2B service is
 * taxed where the buyer is established, so 0% (reverse charge for a VAT-
 * validated EU business, export outside the EU) is the right DEFAULT for a
 * foreign business customer. It is not the only lawful rate: the ML 6 kap.
 * exceptions taxed where the supply is performed (fastighetstjänster 25%,
 * persontransporter 6%, korttidsuthyrning of transport vehicles 25%,
 * restaurang/catering 12%, admission to cultural and sports events 6%) carry
 * Swedish VAT even when the buyer is a German or a US company. A Stockholm
 * hotel night sold to a German company is such a supply, so the picker has to
 * OFFER 12% while still DEFAULTING to 0%.
 *
 * Kept in a plain module (no JSX, no hooks) so the rules are unit-testable:
 * the repo does not render components in tests.

 * invoice, 0% surviving onto a domestic one).
 *
 * A line the user moved off that default is a deliberate choice and is left
 * alone. Snapping every line was the older behaviour and it destroyed the
 * lawful case this whole rule exists for: a 12% hotel night or a 6% event
 * ticket sold to a foreign business, taxed where the supply is performed.
 * Nothing on a line distinguishes those from ordinary consulting, so the
 * user's explicit rate is the only signal there is, and overwriting it would
 * be guessing.
 *
 * Free-text rows (line_type 'text') carry no amounts and never book; they are
 * left untouched so a switch cannot dirty the form with meaningless rates.
