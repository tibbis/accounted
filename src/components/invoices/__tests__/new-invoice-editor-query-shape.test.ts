/**
 * Regression pin for the copy-invoice flow, same class as the article-delete
 * phantom column fixed in #1188. `invoice_items` has NO `company_id` column:
 * it is scoped through its parent invoice. Filtering on it makes PostgREST
 * answer 42703, fetchAllRows rethrows, and the dialog renders the
 * "kunde inte laddas" panel for EVERY company. The loader moved from the
 * list's NewInvoiceDialog to /invoices/new (NewInvoiceEditor) with the editor.
 *
 * This is a component, and the repo does not render components in tests, so
 * there is no behavioral harness that can observe the failing request: pin the
 * query shape in the source instead.
