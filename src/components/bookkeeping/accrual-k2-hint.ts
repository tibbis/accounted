/**
 * K2 vasentlighetsgrans for periodisering, extracted as a pure helper so it
 * can be unit-tested (this repo's Vitest runs in a node environment and does
 * not render components).
 *
 * K2 (BFNAR 2016:10) lets a smaller company skip accruing individual
 * recurring costs below 5 000 kr that do not fluctuate more than 20 % year
 * over year; personnel costs must always be accrued. It is a simplification
 * the company MAY use, never an obligation, so the UI copy it drives is
 * advisory only. That is exactly why it must not fire on an amount we cannot
 * express in kronor: an advisory nudge based on the wrong unit is worse than
 * no nudge at all.
 *
 * The invoice editors hold line amounts in the invoice's currency. A 500 EUR
 * line is roughly 5 750 kr and therefore ABOVE the threshold, but a naive
 * `amount < 5000` reads it as below (and a 400 USD line reads the reverse
 * way once the rate moves). Converting needs an FX rate. The supplier-invoice
 * form has one (Riksbanken-fetched or hand-typed); the customer-invoice
 * editor has none. When no rate is available we return null and the caller
 * shows nothing, rather than guessing a branch.
