/**
 * Read-side payload guards for the member rosters
 * (CompanyMembersSection.tsx, TeamPanel.tsx).
 *
 * A 200 whose body does not carry the expected lists is a failed read, not an
 * empty roster: returning null forces the caller into its error state instead
 * of rendering an apparently member-less company or team. A consultant who
 * sees an empty list re-invites people who are already members, so "cannot
 * read the roster" must never render as "no members".
 *
 * The element types are the caller's own row interfaces; these guards verify
 * the envelope shape (lists are lists, flags are booleans), not the fields of
 * each row.
