/**
 * Dashboard sidebar brand mark: the top-left home link (WL-12 slice A3).
 *
 * On a branded host with an uploaded logo it renders that logo; on every
 * other host it renders exactly the legacy `getBranding().logoPath` image
 * with the same dimensions, classes and aria-label as before, keeping
 * default hosts byte-identical.
 *
 * With `showLabel` (expanded sidebar) a branded host without an uploaded
 * logo renders the brand's app name beside the mark (byra-editable in the
 * Varumärke settings). With an uploaded logo the logo carries the brand
 * alone (same founder call as BrandWordmark, 2026-08-05: byrå logos usually
 * carry their own name, so logo + text read as a duplicate). Unbranded
 * hosts never show a label.
