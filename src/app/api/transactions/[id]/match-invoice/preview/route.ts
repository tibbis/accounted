/**
 * GET /api/transactions/[id]/match-invoice/preview?invoice_id=...
 *
 * Returns the journal entry lines that match-invoice would create for this
 * (transaction, invoice) pair. Read-only: does not stage or write anything.
 *
 * The shape mirrors the routing decision in the POST handler: if the invoice
 * was already booked (invoice.journal_entry_id is set, i.e. 1510 is on the
 * books), we preview the clearing entry (Dr <resolved account> / Cr 1510).
 * Only when the invoice was never booked AND the company is on kontantmetoden
 * AND the receipt fully pays the invoice do we preview the cash entry
 * (Dr <resolved account> / Cr 30xx / Cr 26xx).
 *
 * The bank leg is resolved from THIS transaction's own cash_account_id via
 * resolveSettlementAccount, never hardcoded to 1930, so the preview stays
 * byte-identical to what the POST handler commits (mirrors the fix already
 * applied on the supplier-invoice side).
 *
 * The UI uses this to show the user the exact lines before they confirm:
 * the lack of any preview was part of the reported bug.
