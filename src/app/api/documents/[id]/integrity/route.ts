/**
 * GET /api/documents/:id/integrity
 *
 * Probes the actual stored bytes against the declared MIME type. Used by the
 * Bilagor modal to surface a clear "this file is corrupt: please re-upload"
 * warning instead of relying on the browser's PDF viewer error UI, which
 * only fires after the user has already tried to view the file.
 *
 * Some legacy MCP uploads landed with non-PDF bytes under
 * `mime_type = 'application/pdf'` because magic-byte validation was added
 * after those rows were written. This endpoint lets the UI detect and steer
 * the user toward replacing them.
 *
 * Response shape is intentionally minimal: { valid: boolean } only. The
 * reason for an invalid result is logged server-side rather than returned
 * to the client to avoid information disclosure (V1.2.5 / GDPR Art 25(2))
 * and to keep this from being a probe surface for storage internals.
 *
 * Wrapped in withRouteContext so auth (MFA on hosted), request ids and the
 * completion log follow the house pattern. Authorization is still keyed on
 * the document's own company (a member may probe a document in any company
 * they belong to, same as document_attachments RLS), not on the wrapper's
 * active company.
