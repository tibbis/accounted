/**
 * POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/bank-connections/{connectionId}/sync
 *
 * Trigger a PSD2 sync of one bank connection now, instead of waiting for
 * the nightly cron. The window is not caller-controlled: the same gap-aware
 * incremental lookback the cron uses (7 days, widened to cover any gap since
 * last_synced_at, capped at 90). A connection synced or attempted within the
 * last 15 minutes answers 429 BANK_SYNC_COOLDOWN with next_allowed_at (the
 * attempt guard is a durable lease on the row, claimed atomically), so an
 * unattended agent can never run up the Enable Banking bill by polling, even
 * across serverless instances.
 *
 * What this cannot do: revive a dead consent. status=expired (or a session
 * the bank reports dead mid-sync) needs BankID in a browser; the response
 * says so and points at the connect link.
 *
 * The runner lives in the enable-banking extension. Core cannot import it
 * (CI guard), so it is reached through the registry-resolved `services`
 * channel declared in lib/bank-sync/trigger-sync-contract.ts, and a
 * deployment without the extension answers EXTENSION_DISABLED.

  description:
    'Fetches new transactions and balances for one PSD2 bank connection right away. The window is chosen server-side: the last 7 days, widened to cover any gap since last_synced_at, capped at 90 days. Returns how many transactions were imported and the new last_synced_at. A connection synced within the last 15 minutes is refused with 429 BANK_SYNC_COOLDOWN and next_allowed_at: the data is already fresh. Not dry-runnable: the bank call itself is the side effect.',
  useWhen:
    'GET /bank-connections shows a stale last_synced_at on an active connection and you need current bank data before building on it (liquidity, reconciliation, a report), or the user asks for the latest transactions now.',
  doNotUseFor:
    'Polling. Connections sync every night on their own; call this once when freshness matters, then read /transactions. Fixing a dead connection: status=expired needs BankID in a browser, not a sync.',
  pitfalls: [
    'Idempotency-Key is optional here. If you send one, use a fresh key per attempt: a cooldown answer is never cached, but a completed sync is, and replaying it fetches nothing new.',
    '429 BANK_SYNC_COOLDOWN follows a recent successful sync OR a recent attempt that failed (the 15-minute lease is taken before the bank is called, on every instance). Compare last_synced_at from GET /bank-connections: if it is fresh, use the data you have; if it is still stale, the previous attempt failed, so retry once after next_allowed_at (Retry-After is set).',
    '429 BANK_RATE_LIMITED is the BANK limiting the consent (PSD2 banks allow only a few unattended fetches per day), not this API. The connection stays valid: do not renew it. Wait until next_allowed_at (Retry-After is set); it is our cooldown, not a reset time confirmed by the bank.',
    '409 BANK_SESSION_EXPIRED means the bank reported the consent dead during the sync; the connection is now status=expired. Hand the user the connect link; no API call revives it.',
    'imported: 0 is normal on a quiet account. Banks report with up to 48 hours of delay, so today\'s transactions often arrive tomorrow.',
    'Costs one Enable Banking call per enabled account: 403 CAPABILITY_BLOCKED when the company has no bank_sync entitlement.',
