/**
 * POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/invoices/{id}/send
 *
 * Full send pipeline. Renders the invoice PDF, allocates the F-series
 * number, issues the invoice (status sent + the journal entry when the
 * company books at issue), emails it to the customer (with a copy to the
 * company), archives the PDF as underlag, and emits invoice.sent. This is
 * :mark-sent + PDF + email + archival.
 *
 * Failure ordering (the same as the dashboard's internal
 * /api/invoices/[id]/send, so the two surfaces stay reconcilable):
 *
 *   1. Email service NOT configured → 503 INVOICE_SEND_EMAIL_NOT_CONFIGURED.
 *      Hard fail before any state changes.
 *   2. Customer has no email → 400 INVOICE_SEND_NO_CUSTOMER_EMAIL.
 *   3. Company settings missing → 404 INVOICE_SEND_COMPANY_SETTINGS_MISSING.
 *   4. Cancelled invoices are rejected: sending one would silently
 *      re-activate it (the status flip below has no race guard tightening
 *      `cancelled`). Returns 400 INVOICE_SEND_CANCELLED.
 *   5. Preflight PDF render (with a placeholder F-PREVIEW number) validates
 *      the rendering pipeline BEFORE consuming an F-series number. Fail →
 *      500 INVOICE_SEND_PDF_RENDER_FAILED, no number burned.
 *   6. ensureInvoiceNumber allocates the F-series number atomically.
 *      Fail → 500 INVOICE_SEND_NUMBER_ASSIGN_FAILED.
 *   6b. Auto-create an online payment link (extension-provided, e.g. Stripe)
 *      and persist it on the invoice row. Best-effort: a provider or persist
 *      failure never blocks the send; it surfaces as a PAYMENT_LINK_FAILED
 *      warning on the response once the email is delivered.
 *   7. Final PDF render with the real number.
 *   8. Issue BEFORE delivery (markInvoiceSentAndBook, the step :mark-sent,
 *      the dashboard send and the recurring auto-send share): status flip
 *      draft → sent (compare-and-set, the single-winner lock) and the
 *      journal entry (book-at-issue + real invoice), fail closed. A refused
 *      verifikat (a required dimension, an archived dimension value, a
 *      locked period) returns the engine's error with the invoice back in
 *      draft and nothing sent; a concurrent issuer answers 409
 *      INVOICE_UPDATE_NOT_DRAFT before any email.
 *   9. Email send via the email extension (Resend or SMTP). Fail with
 *      nothing booked → the invoice returns to draft and 502
 *      INVOICE_SEND_PROVIDER_FAILED (the number stays consumed, same
 *      orphan window as :mark-sent). Fail after the journal entry posted →
 *      502 INVOICE_SEND_ISSUED_NOT_DELIVERED: the invoice stays issued (a
 *      posted verifikat is never undone), its PDF is archived as underlag,
 *      and it is delivered another way.
 *  10. After delivery, best-effort: PDF link to the journal entry and the
 *      invoice.sent event; failures surface as `warnings`.
 *
 * Idempotent (mandatory Idempotency-Key). Dry-runnable: dry-run goes
 * through steps 1-5 (validation + preflight PDF) without allocating a
 * number, sending email, or mutating state.
