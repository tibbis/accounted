/**
 * POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/invoices/{id}/mark-paid
 *
 * Manually marks an invoice as paid: for payments received outside the
 * bank-sync flow.
 *
 * Accounting:
 *   - Faktureringsmetoden (accrual): Debit 1930 / Credit 1510. The invoice
 *     was already booked as revenue at :mark-sent; this just settles the AR.
 *   - Kontantmetoden (cash): Debit 1930 / Credit 30xx + Credit 26xx. Revenue
 *     recognition happens here (no entry at :mark-sent under cash basis).
 *
 * Optional request body (all fields optional: empty POST = book full payment
 * on today's date with default lines):
 *   - payment_date              ISO date; defaults to today
 *   - exchange_rate_difference  SEK adjustment for foreign-currency invoices
 *   - lines                     Custom balanced journal lines (partial payments)
 *
 * Idempotent (mandatory Idempotency-Key). Dry-runnable.
 *
 * On commit:
 *   1. Build journal entry (default 1930/1510 split, or custom lines).
 *   2. Post via createInvoicePaymentJournalEntry / createJournalEntry.
 *   3. Update invoice: status → 'paid' (or 'partially_paid' for partial),
 *      remaining_amount decremented, paid_at set, paid_amount accumulated.
 *   4. Emit invoice.paid.
