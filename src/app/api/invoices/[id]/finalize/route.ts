 * POST /api/invoices/[id]/finalize: "Granska och skapa".
 *
 * Turns an unnumbered draft (saved via "Spara som utkast") into a real, issued
 * invoice: allocates the F-series number and emits invoice.created (which drives
 * webhooks + the audit log). After this the invoice behaves exactly like one
 * created directly: it can be sent or cancelled (makulerad), but no longer
 * hard-deleted, because the number now belongs to the gap-free series
 * (ML 17 kap 24§).
 *
 * Only an unnumbered draft (status='draft', invoice_number IS NULL,
 * document_type='invoice') may be finalized. Numbering is idempotent inside the
 * generate_invoice_number RPC, but the explicit guard keeps the contract clear.
