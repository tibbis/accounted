/**
 * POST /api/invoices/preview-email
 *
 * The email the invoice editor's draft would be sent with, rendered by the
 * real invoice email template without saving or sending anything: the
 * customer's language, the company's email texts (Inställningar > Utskick)
 * and, when given, this send's own email_subject / email_body (the same
 * fields POST /api/invoices/{id}/send takes). The draft is built exactly as
 * the PDF preview builds it (lib/invoices/preview-draft.ts), so the two
 * state the same amount and payment details.
 *
 * Returns { data: { subject, html, editable, from, reply_to, to, cc, missing } }:
 *  - editable: { subject, body }, the subject and message as text to edit,
 *    placeholders left in ({fakturanummer}, ...): what the editor's
 *    "Redigera text för den här fakturan" starts from and sends back as
 *    email_subject / email_body;
 *  - from: the sender's display name, and its address when the company
 *    sends from its own verified domain (null = the platform address);
 *  - reply_to: where a reply lands (null = the template leaves out the
 *    "reply to this email" line);
 *  - to / cc: the customer's address and the fixed copies (company and
 *    customer card). Per-send extra copies and BCC are not shown here;
 *  - missing: what the draft still lacks (customer, rows, payee).
