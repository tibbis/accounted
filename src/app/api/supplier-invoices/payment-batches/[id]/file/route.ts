/**
 * Download the payment file for a batch.

 * The file regenerates deterministically from the stored batch + item rows:
 * msg_id and created_at were fixed at creation, so every download is
 * byte-identical and the bank's duplicate detection (keyed on MsgId) stays
 * meaningful. requireWrite because the download stamps file_generated_at and
 * bumps download_count (the tax payment-file route sets the precedent).
 *
 * Per BFL the generated file is räkenskapsinformation (underlag) for the
 * payments it initiates; the batch rows it derives from are retained.
 * Rules in lib/payments/batch-operations.ts (shared with v1).
