/**
 * GET /api/company/check-org-number?org_number=XXXXXXXXXX
 *
 * Returns `{ data: { exists, companies } }`: matches among the CURRENT USER's
 * own companies (`{ id, name }[]`), scoped by RLS. Nothing about other
 * accounts leaves the server: whether the same org number exists under
 * someone else's account is not the caller's business (a company can be
 * set up in several accounts on purpose; the founder removed the
 * "finns redan i Accounted" hint 2026-09-09).
 *
 * Org-number reuse across the platform is intentionally allowed (see
 * lib/company/actions.ts), so this is a soft "you already have it" note, NOT
 * a uniqueness gate. The query uses the authenticated client on purpose: the
 * `companies` SELECT RLS policy limits results to companies the caller is a
 * member of (id IN user_company_ids()).
 *
 * Normalizes input with the same rule as the create action so a 12-digit form
 * still matches a stored 10-digit canonical. Returns no matches for malformed
 * input: the create action rejects that separately as `org_number_invalid`.
