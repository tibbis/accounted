 * Invite handoff for the password-recovery flow.
 *
 * `/reset-password` was the only session-establishing path that never picked
 * the pre-auth invite cookie back up. Login, register and `/mfa/verify` all
 * call `consumeInviteCookie()`; the recovery flow did not, and the server-side
 * safety nets do not cover it. `acceptPendingInviteByToken()`
 * (lib/company/pending-invites.ts) runs only on `/onboarding` and
 * `/select-company`, and `/onboarding` is reachable only for a user with zero
 * companies. A consultant who already has a company of their own therefore had
 * no route back to the invitation at all after resetting their password.
 *
 * This module holds the decision only. The POST, the status classification and
 * the "clear the cookie on a definitive outcome, keep it otherwise" rule all
 * stay in `lib/auth/consume-invite-cookie.ts`: this is the fifth caller of that
 * helper, not a fifth copy of it.
 *
 * It lives beside `page.tsx` rather than inside it because a Next.js page file
 * may not export anything but the page component and the route segment config,
 * which would leave the flow untestable in a repo with no component harness.

 * AAL1. Attempting the acceptance while a step-up is owed returns a bare 403,

 * legitimate invitee would be told their invitation belongs to someone else.

 * and "the middleware will bounce this user to /mfa/verify" the same statement:
 * the cookie survives untouched and `/mfa/verify` consumes it once the second
 * factor is in. A user the step-up does not apply to (self-hosted,
 * BankID-linked, exempt) is deliberately never deferred, because nothing would
 * bounce them and the token would sit there unused.
 *
 * A failed read is not evidence of a pending step-up, so it falls through to
