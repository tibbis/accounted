/**
 * Where a supplier keeps its invoices, when it does not send them.
 *
 * Some vendors never attach anything. They mail "your invoice is ready", or
 * nothing at all, and the invoice waits behind a login. Presto built a business
 * on logging in for you, across a thousand portals, with a desktop app so the
 * credentials never leave the machine. We deliberately do not: holding a
 * customer's supplier passwords is the expensive and legally heavy half of that
 * product, and skipping it costs little of the value.
 *
 * What is left is knowing *where*. Seeing "OPENAI  CHATGPT SUBSCR" on a
 * statement is enough to say which page the invoice is on, and that turns a
 * dead end into a one-click errand.
 *
 * The lookup happens at read time and nothing is stored against a transaction.
 * Adding an entry therefore fixes every ledger at once, retroactively, with no
 * migration and no backfill: a supplier someone adds today starts answering for
 * purchases made last year.
 *
 * ## What belongs here
 *
 * A vendor whose invoice a human can fetch from a stable page. Not payment
 * types that have no invoice at all: tax, salary, bank fees. The hunt already
 * refuses to search mail for those, and offering a link would be worse than
 * silence.
 *
 * ## Entries are unverified until someone checks them
 *
 * A wrong URL is worse than a missing one: it sends somebody to a page that
 * cannot help and spends the trust the feature runs on. These were chosen for
 * having a stable, well-known billing page, and each still deserves a human
 * clicking it. Vendors whose billing page could not be pinned down were left
 * out rather than guessed at.

/**
 * Ordered by how many companies actually pay them, measured across production
 * ledgers, cross-checked against a customer poll.
 *
 * The bar is "does not send the invoice", not "also has a portal". Almost every
 * vendor here has a billing page; what earns an entry is that the invoice does
 * not arrive by mail, so a person has no other way to get it.
 *
 * Anthropic, Vercel and Supabase were removed after a founder pointed out that
 * all three do email their invoices, at least to European customers. The poll
 * they came from asked which portals people log into, and people answered with
 * where the invoice can ALSO be found. Listing them told somebody to go and log
 * in for a document already sitting in their inbox, which is worse than saying
 * nothing: it sends them away from the answer.
 *
 * The same objection may reach further down this list. An entry is a claim that
 * the invoice cannot be had any other way, and that claim is worth checking per
 * vendor rather than assuming.
 *
 * ## The URLs were wrong, and shipped anyway
 *
 * Every path here was hand-written and none was opened. The file said so and
 * shipped regardless, and a founder then hit a 404 on Google Workspace. A
 * subsequent HTTP sweep found GitHub's billing path 404 as well. Both are
 * corrected; Trygg Hansa was removed because neither of its candidate URLs
 * could be reached at all, and an unverifiable link is the same promise this
 * comment keeps warning about.
 *
 * Prefer the shallowest URL that certainly resolves. A link landing one click
 * short of the invoice is a small cost; one landing on an error page spends
 * the trust the whole feature runs on. Several hosts here (Google, OpenAI,
 * Hetzner) refuse an automated request, so they cannot be swept: those stay
 * shallow on purpose.
