/**
 * Turning a mailbox hit into an underlag the user can approve.
 *
 * Lives in core rather than in the mail extension because it writes documents
 * and inbox items, and an extension may never import another extension. The
 * mail extension only ever hands over bytes.
 *
 * The hunt does NOT book anything and does not link anything by itself: it
 * stores the receipt, records where it came from, and stages the pairing. The
 * document becomes räkenskapsinformation only when a human approves.
 *
 * The mail door enters the same pipe as the other doors. uploadDocument
 * archives the bytes (deduplicated on content) and announces them, which
 * queues the Arkiv read and classification like any upload; once Arkiv has
 * typed the document, the invoice inbox routes this item exactly like an
 * emailed one (route-from-arkiv.ts), and its sweep catches a deduplicated
 * document Arkiv had typed before. Extraction is left to the default owner,
 * the document-extraction extension, awaited inside uploadDocument: core
 * cannot run the inbox's own extraction ('invoice-inbox' owner), and unlike a
 * Peppol invoice ('none') a mail attachment carries no structured data. The
 * item stays source 'mail_hunt', with the provenance in channel_context.
