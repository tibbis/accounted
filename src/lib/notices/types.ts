   * Stable identity of THIS occurrence: the category plus a state
   * discriminator (connection id + status, expiry date). A dismissal is
   * stored against the id, so dismissals silence a state, never a category.
   *
   * Two invariants keep dismissals honest, and every id must satisfy both:
   *
   * 1. Stable per incident: the discriminator must not embed anything the
   *    system re-stamps while the SAME incident persists (a cron-updated
   *    last-attempt timestamp), or a dismissed notice resurrects daily.
   *    backup_failing therefore discriminates on (provider, reason) only.
   * 2. Reaped on recovery: the read path (getCompanyNotices) best-effort
   *    deletes the caller's stored dismissals for any category that is
   *    currently healthy, matched by the `category:` id prefix. That is what
   *    makes a NEW failure after a healthy spell resurface even when it mints
   *    the exact same id as the dismissed one: error -> dismiss (hidden while
   *    failing) -> healthy (dismissal reaped on the next read) -> new error
   *    -> visible again. Categories whose id changes per incident anyway
   *    (bank ids embed connection id + status/expiry, skv embeds the
   *    incident's first-error/expiry timestamp) get the same reaping as
   *    hygiene. other_account_hint has no `category:` prefix and is never
   *    reaped: dismissing it silences the condition itself.
   *
   * Ids are also bounded: multi-connection discriminators collapse to a
   * count + 8-char sha256 digest of the sorted parts (categories.ts), so an
   * id never grows with the number of connections and stays well under the
   * dismiss schema cap (lib/api/schemas.ts).
