 * `codesByAccount` is source account number to the provider's verbatim code
 * and `translate` turns a code into a treatment for that account, or null
 * when the code has no equivalent there.
 *
 * Both are stored as facts about the source account (providerVatCode,
 * providerVatTreatment); the row's suggestion is derived from them by
 * enrichAccountMappingsWithVat, which every consumer runs. The translated
 * code is a SUGGESTION, not a reviewed value: it still needs the row's
 * confirm (or "Bekräfta alla föreslagna"), because a reviewed row is written
 * onto an existing chart account by syncMappedAccounts and the mapping step
 * is skipped when nothing needs review. A code the user never saw must not
 * overwrite a treatment they cleared in Accounted on a later re-sync.
 *
 * Only class 3-6 identity mappings are touched, the same rows the label
 * suggestion covers: a remapped account gets the target's treatment, and
 * classes 1-2 and 7-8 carry no treatment.
 *
 * Two kinds of already-answered row, and they are not the same:
 *
 *   The USER answered it in this step. Never touched. applyVatTreatmentReview
 *   leaves requiresVatTreatmentReview as it found it, so reviewed AND required
 *   is the signature of a human answer.
 *
 *   The COMPANY CHART answered it, which enrichAccountMappingsWithVat records
 *   by clearing requiresVatTreatmentReview. Here the file is the newer
 *   statement about the same account and may update it, because a source
 *   system does move a code between fiscal years: Spiris swapped the names AND
 *   the codes of 3541 and 3542 between 2022 and 2023, so last year's treatment
 *   on this year's account would file EU sales as export. Such a row is left
 *   as it is while the file agrees, and re-opened for review only when it does
 *   not, so a multi-year migration does not re-confirm dozens of unchanged
 *   rows every year.
 *
 * Every row it does not touch is returned BY REFERENCE, which is what lets a
 * caller tell what this file changed from what an earlier one did.
