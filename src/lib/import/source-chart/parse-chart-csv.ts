 * Parser for a source accounting system's chart-of-accounts CSV export.
 *
 * SIE4 carries no VAT codes, so the guided import has only the account label to
 * go on and a label regex is the ceiling. A chart export from the system being
 * left behind usually does carry them, which is what this reads.
 *
 * Written against Spiris exports, which are UTF-8 with a BOM, semicolon
 * separated and CRLF terminated. All three are traps: the BOM corrupts the
 * first column name if the caller does not strip it, semicolon is nobody's
 * default, and a lone CR left on the last field silently breaks equality
 * comparisons. Columns are looked up by header NAME rather than position, so a
 * reordered or extended export keeps working.
