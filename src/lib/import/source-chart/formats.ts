 * The chart-of-accounts export formats this project can read.
 *
 * Declarative on purpose: a new accounting system is an entry in the list plus
 * a translate function, not a new parser. Everything that differs between
 * vendors (delimiter, column names, VAT code vocabulary) is data here.
 *
 * The format is detected from the header rather than picked by the user. Column
 * sets are effectively fingerprints, vendors do not collide on them, and asking
 * would put the burden on the one fact the user is least sure of: this product
 * was called Visma eEkonomi until recently and is now Spiris Bokföring, so a
 * dropdown turns a rename into a wrong answer on a correct file. Detection is
 * reported back instead, so a wrong guess is visible rather than silent.
