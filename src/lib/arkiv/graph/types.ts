/**
 * Arkiv phase 9b: the graph read model. One picture of everything Accounted

 * The one rule: the graph is never a second truth. Every node is a row that
 * exists, every link is a foreign key, a match the pipeline made, or an
 * aggregate of those. A node's `ref` is the record reference the MCP tools
 * already take (agreement:<id>, party:<id>, document:<id>, fact:<id>), plus
 * the ledger and derived kinds this model adds.
