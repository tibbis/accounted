/**
 * The accounts a bank connection offers, as the onboarding picker renders them.
 *
 * The callback's cross-company guard stores an account that another of the
 * user's companies already books as enabled:false with claimed_by_company_id
 * (app/api/extensions/enable-banking/callback/route.ts). That flag is a notice,
 * never a block: one bank account belongs to one legal entity, but the app
 * cannot know which of two companies is the right home for it, so the picker
 * shows every account the consent returned, names the company that books a
 * claimed one, and leaves the choice to the user (founder direction
 * 2026-09-15, issue #2647). Hiding claimed accounts, which is what the picker
 * did before, left a user whose whole consent was claimed on a blank page.
