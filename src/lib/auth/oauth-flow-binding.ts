/**
 * Bind the completion of a browser-driven OAuth/consent flow to the user who
 * started it.
 *
 * Our OAuth callbacks (Enable Banking, Stripe Connect, WooCommerce wc-auth)
 * locate the pending connection row by the single-use `oauth_state` token and
 * then finalize it for that row's `user_id` / `company_id`. The token proves
 * the callback belongs to a flow WE started; it does not prove that the
 * browser completing it belongs to the user who started it. Without this
 * check, a victim who is lured into completing a consent an attacker
 * initiated (the authorize URL is shareable) has their bank / Stripe / store
 * attached to the attacker's company.
 *
 * Consent redirects are top-level navigations, so on the legitimate path the
 * initiator's own session cookies arrive with the callback. This helper reads
 * that cookie session and compares it to the expected initiator.
 *
 * Outcomes:
 *   - ok: the session user is the initiator; carry on.
 *   - no_session: nobody is signed in (expired mid-flow, cookies cleared, or
 *     the session lives on another host). `response` redirects to
 *     /login?next=<this callback URL> so the initiator can sign in and the
 *     callback re-runs with the same code + state. The login lives on the
 *     origin the flow was started from when the caller recorded one: provider
 *     redirect URIs are pinned to the canonical host while sessions are per
 *     host, so a white-label user reaches the callback signed out and must be
 *     sent to THEIR brand host, where the session already exists and the
 *     login page forwards straight back into the callback.
 *   - mismatch: a different user is signed in. `response` is a 403 in the
 *     canonical error envelope; a route whose UX is a settings redirect
 *     inspects `reason` and builds its own redirect instead. The mismatch is
 *     logged with both ids redacted to prefixes.
 *
 * Deliberately not `requireAuth()`: this is an equality check on identity,
 * not an authorization gate. The route that STARTED the flow already ran the
 * MFA-enforcing guard for this user, and a 403 here for an aal1 session would
 * strand the user (the callback has no MFA prompt to send them to).
