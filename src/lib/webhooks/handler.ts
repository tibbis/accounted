/**
 * Webhook event-bus handler.
 *
 * Subscribes to every CoreEventType the v1 API surface emits and converts
 * each emission into N rows in `webhook_deliveries`: one per active webhook
 * subscribed to (company_id, event_type). A dispatch cycle is then scheduled
 * immediately (see dispatch-kick.ts); the per-minute cron stays as the retry
 * and sweep path.
 *
 * Wired from lib/init.ts via registerWebhookHandler() so every API route
 * that calls ensureInitialized() gets the subscription wired exactly once.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *   - We do NOT block the emitting route on delivery insert: the handler
 *     runs inside Promise.allSettled in the bus (see lib/events/bus.ts), so
 *     a DB insert failure is logged but doesn't crash the emitter.
 *   - We capture `previous_attributes` only for events whose payload carries
 *     both a prior and current shape. Phase 6 PR-1 emits null for everything:
 *     adding the diff is a follow-up that requires touching each route's
 *     emit() call site to capture the prior row.
 *   - Service-role client because this code runs from the bus, outside any
 *     authenticated Supabase context.
