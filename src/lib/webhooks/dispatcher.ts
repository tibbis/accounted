/**
 * Webhook delivery dispatcher.
 *
 * Invoked from two places: the per-minute cron at /api/webhooks/dispatch/cron,
 * and an emit-triggered kick right after deliveries are enqueued
 * (lib/webhooks/dispatch-kick.ts), which is what keeps first-attempt latency
 * off the cron interval. Picks up pending + retry-due deliveries (FOR UPDATE
 * SKIP LOCKED, so a kick racing the cron claims disjoint rows), POSTs each one
 * with HMAC signature, and updates the row to one of:
 *
 *   - delivered (2xx response)         : terminal
 *   - failed   (5xx / network / 4xx    : non-terminal until attempts
 *               other than 410)         exhausted; bumps next_attempt_at
 *               by exponential backoff
 *   - dead     (HTTP 410 OR             : terminal
 *               attempts exhausted)
 *
 * The receiver is expected to respond within 10 seconds; we time out
 * aggressively so a slow receiver doesn't block the per-minute cron.
 *
 * On HTTP 410 we additionally disable the webhook (sets disabled_at +
 * disabled_reason='HTTP 410 from receiver') so future events don't even
 * enqueue against it.
 *
 * A delivery whose endpoint has not passed the ownership handshake (and is not
 * in a legacy grace window, lib/webhooks/verification.ts) is withheld: no
 * request, counted as a failed attempt with error 'endpoint_unverified'.

/**
 * Sweep in_flight rows whose updated_at is older than the stuck-threshold
 * back into the retry queue, charging an attempt for the stall so
 * MAX_ATTEMPTS stays a real cap. Best-effort: a failure here is logged but
 * doesn't block the rest of the cycle.
 *
 * The predicate now lives in SQL (recover_stuck_webhook_deliveries,
 * migration 20260730123000) rather than in a PostgREST chain, because
 * PostgREST can express neither `attempts = attempts + 1` nor the
 * conditional flip to 'dead' at the cap, and a read-then-write loop would
 * reopen a TOCTOU against enforce_webhook_delivery_immutability. MAX_ATTEMPTS
 * and RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS are passed in so the cap AND the schedule stay
 * single-sourced here in TS.
 *
 * A swept row is re-armed on the SAME backoff the normal failure path uses
 * (markFailedForRetry), not immediately: a row that keeps getting stranded
 * (deploy, instance recycle, a cycle that outlives its invocation) would
 * otherwise be re-claimed on the very next per-minute tick, and could burn
 * all MAX_ATTEMPTS in under half an hour and land in the terminal, immutable
 * 'dead' state without its receiver ever having been contacted. The ~87 h
 * retry schedule is the delivery guarantee; the sweep must not shorten it.
 *
 * Under READ COMMITTED (Postgres default), UPDATE re-evaluates the WHERE
 * clause against each row's current value when it acquires the row lock.
 * The function keeps `status = 'in_flight'` in the outer UPDATE's WHERE for
 * exactly that reason: a row that raced from 'in_flight' to
 * 'delivered'/'dead' between scan and lock fails re-evaluation and is
 * skipped entirely, so the immutability trigger never fires and a mid-flight
 * terminal flip cannot abort the sweep.
