/**
 * Stuck-in_flight recovery and per-row re-stamping (#1257).
 *
 * Two defects are pinned here:
 *
 * 1. the sweep window used to be a fixed 2x REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS (20 s), which
 *    is shorter than a single serial cycle, so cycle N recovered rows cycle
 *    N-1 was still working through;
 * 2. recovery reset rows to 'failed' without charging an attempt, so
 *    MAX_ATTEMPTS stopped being a real cap.
 *
 * The window is now derived from the bounded cycle and the cap is enforced
 * server-side by recover_stuck_webhook_deliveries, so the assertions here are
 * about what the dispatcher hands the RPC and about the per-row re-stamp that
 * makes a row's in_flight age measure its own attempt.
