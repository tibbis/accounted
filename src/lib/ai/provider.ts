 * account at all, so they get the direct Anthropic API with a plain
 * ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (the Swedish inference
 * providers a sovereign self-host points at, or a local model) via
 * AI_BASE_URL (+ AI_API_KEY when the endpoint requires auth).
 *
 * The two Anthropic-family backends share the `messages.create/stream`
 * surface this factory hands out. The OpenAI-compatible backend does not: it
 * is reachable only through the job-shaped service in lib/ai (getAiService),
 * and createAiClient() refuses it loudly rather than returning a client that
 * would fail at call time.
 *
 * See https://github.com/erp-mafia/accounted/issues/1406.
