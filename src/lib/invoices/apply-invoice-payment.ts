/**
 * Single source of truth for applying a payment amount to a customer invoice.
 *
 * Computes the new paid/remaining/status and: critically: REJECTS overpayment
 * before the caller creates any journal entry, so a doomed match never burns a
 * voucher number.
 *
 * Background: this math was copy-pasted across three sites: the dashboard
 * match-invoice route (which had the overpayment guard), the v1 public API
 * route, and `commitMatchTransactionInvoice` (the agent/MCP path). The latter
 * two had drifted WITHOUT the guard, so they silently swallowed overpayment via
 * `Math.max(0, …)`: recording e.g. 1500 paid on a 1000 invoice and
 * over-crediting accounts receivable. Centralizing the math + guard here closes
 * that drift; all three sites delegate to `planInvoicePayment`.
 *
 * FX: `paymentAmountInInvoiceCurrency` MUST already be in the invoice's
 * currency. The caller owns any conversion (cross-currency settlement lives in
 * the dashboard route), keeping this helper FX-agnostic.
 *
 * Extracted from the proven dashboard route with the same half-öre overshoot
 * tolerance. Rounding goes through the canonical `roundOre` (@/lib/money) per
 * guard rail #9: identical to the route's previous `Math.round(x*100)/100`
 * except on exact-half-öre amounts, where `roundOre` rounds correctly.
