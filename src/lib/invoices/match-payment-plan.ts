/**
 * The payment plan for matching ONE bank transaction to ONE customer invoice:
 * the FX resolution and the `planInvoicePayment` call (overshoot guard,
 * öresavrundning, paid/remaining/status) that the agent commit executor
 * (`commitMatchTransactionInvoice`) runs before it posts anything.
 *
 * Shared with the MCP tools that STAGE that operation, so a match the approval
 * would refuse is refused when it is staged, from the same inputs: the
 * transaction and invoice currencies, the pure-SEK öre absorption, and the
 * invoice's remaining amount after any partial payments already applied.
 * Before this, staging validated invoice state only and an overpaid match was
 * accepted, then rejected at approval (crm#253).
 *
 * Read-only: the only side effect is the exchange-rate cache that
 * `fetchExchangeRate` maintains for a cross-currency match.
