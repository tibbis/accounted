/**
 * Which PDF the invoice detail page may hand the user, and what it must be
 * called when it does.
 *
 * A sent invoice has an archived delivery: the exact file the customer
 * received, captured before the provider call and kept in the WORM archive
 * (`invoice_deliveries.document_attachment_id`, held down by
 * `block_sent_invoice_document_deletion`). That file is räkenskapsinformation:
 * BFL 7 kap requires it preserved for 7 years, in varaktigt läsbart skick, and
 * producible on request as a faithful reproduction.
 *
 * `/api/invoices/[id]/pdf` does NOT return that file. It re-renders from
 * today's invoice row, today's customer row, today's company_settings and
 * today's branding/logo. Whenever any of those changed since the send, the
 * re-render is a different document. It is a perfectly legitimate document in
 * its own right; it is simply not the one that was sent, and it must never be
 * served as though it were.
 *
 * Hence three outcomes that are never allowed to collapse into each other:
 *
 *  - `archived`:    the delivered file exists. Serve it. Nothing to explain.
 *  - `unavailable`: the delivery history could not be read, so whether an
 *                   archived copy exists is unknown. Substituting a re-render
 *                   here is the bug this module exists to prevent: the caller
 *                   must ask the user, not guess on their behalf.
 *  - `rerender`:    no archived copy can be served, and `reason` says why, so
 *                   the caller can label what it hands over instead of
 *                   presenting it as the sent document.

 * räkenskapsinformation. Blocking those behind a dialog would trade a real cost
 * (a draft you cannot download because an unrelated request failed) for a
 * near-empty risk, so the gate stays narrow.
 *
 * This list only governs the unreadable case. When the history DID load it is
 * the data, not the status, that decides: an emailed proforma that was later
 * makulerad still has its archived copy and still gets served it.
