/**
 * ONE payment QR code per invoice, chosen here.
 *
 * The PDF used to stack up to three codes (Swish, the payment link and the
 * bank-app UsingQR code), each behind its own switch, which moved the
 * payment box around and printed different codes on different invoices of
 * one company. Now every render path asks this resolver which single code to
 * print, and the invoice editor asks it why there is none.
 *
 * Mode: invoices.qr_mode ?? company_settings.invoice_qr_mode ?? 'auto'.
 *
 *   auto          a private customer (customer_type individual) gets Swish
 *                 when Swish is usable; otherwise the bank-app QR when it is
 *                 usable, else Swish, else the payment-link QR when the
 *                 invoice has a link, else none. A customer outside Sweden
 *                 never gets the bank-app or the Swish code (both need a
 *                 Swedish bank): the payment-link QR when there is a link,
 *                 else none (foreign_customer)
 *   bank_app      the UsingQR code a Swedish bank app scans (SEK, a printed
 *                 bankgiro or plusgiro with a valid check digit, org number)
 *   swish         the Swish code (SEK, a printed, valid Swish number)
 *   payment_link  the invoice's payment link
 *   none          no code
 *
 * An explicit mode that cannot be printed resolves to none WITH the reason:
 * it never silently prints another code than the one the user chose.
 *
 * Every code encodes what the invoice still asks for (lib/invoices/amount-due):
 * nothing on a paid, cancelled or credited invoice or a document that is not
 * a payment request, and the remainder on a partly paid one.
 *
 * The company passed in must already carry the invoice's payee
 * (companyWithInvoicePaymentAccount), the same company the PDF renders with,
 * so the code pays to the account the page prints.
 *
 * Pure and isomorphic (no fs, no crypto): the invoice editor imports it.
