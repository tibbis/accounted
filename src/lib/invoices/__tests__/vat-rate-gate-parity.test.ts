/**
 * Every server-side write path that validates an invoice line's VAT rate must
 * gate on the SAME set, or the surfaces disagree about what is lawful: the web
 * UI would accept a 12% hotel night to a German company while the REST bulk
 * create, an MCP-staged commit, a recurring schedule or a self-bill refused it.
 *
 * The guarantee is structural, not coincidental: all of them call the one shared
 * getPermittedVatRates(customer_type, vat_number_validated) with the same two
 * fields off the same customers row, and all of them fall back to
 * getVatRules().rate (0% for a foreign business) when a line omits vat_rate. So
 * this pins the call, which is the part a future edit could quietly change back.
 *
 * The MCP staging tool (gnubok_create_invoice) is in the list too: it gates at
 * staging time, so gating it on the default set refused a lawful invoice before
 * the executor's own gate was ever reached.
