/**
 * Bulk reconcile supplier invoices to already-posted GL payment vouchers.
 *
 * Context: when a company is migrated from another system (e.g. Fortnox via the
 * arcim-migration extension), the general ledger: including the bank-payment
 * vouchers that settle accounts payable (Dr 2440 / Cr 1930): is imported
 * separately via SIE. Supplier invoices are imported as standalone
 * `supplier_invoices` rows with NO link to those vouchers (the entity mapper
 * never sets `payment_journal_entry_id`). Fortnox is queried with
 * `?filter=unpaid`, so an invoice whose payment was booked in the source GL but
 * never registered against the leverantörsfaktura object arrives here as an
 * open payable. Once its due date passes the nightly cron flips it to
 * `overdue`: even though the settling voucher already exists in the GL.
 *
 * This pass links each open payable to its matching posted voucher (reusing the
 * exact same matcher + RPC behind the manual "Markera som betald → Befintlig
 * verifikation" UI flow), so genuinely-settled invoices show as paid instead of
 * falsely overdue. It NEVER creates, edits, or deletes a journal entry: it only
 * inserts a `supplier_invoice_payments` row pointing at the existing voucher and
 * advances the invoice's paid/remaining/status (all via the atomic
 * `link_supplier_invoice_to_voucher` RPC).
 *
 * Safety: auto-linking is intentionally conservative. A voucher is linked
 * automatically only when the match is unambiguous (see AUTO_LINK_* constants
 * and the uniqueness rules below). Everything else is surfaced for manual review
 * rather than guessed at. The function is idempotent and order-independent: it
 * can be re-run any time after both halves of a migration exist.
