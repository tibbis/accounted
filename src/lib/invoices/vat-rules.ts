 * VAT-validated EU business, export outside the EU) is the right DEFAULT for a
 * foreign business customer. It is not the only lawful rate.
 *
 * ML 6 kap. (plats för transaktioner) carries exceptions that are taxed where
 * the supply is performed, and therefore carry Swedish VAT even when the buyer
 * is a foreign business. Per the swedish-vat reference, the exceptions "(taxed
 * where performed)" are:
 *
 *   - Fastighetstjänster (property location)                        25%
 *   - Persontransporter (where transport occurs)                     6%

 *   - Admission to cultural/sports events (event location)           6%
 *
 * A Stockholm hotel night or a conference ticket sold to a German or a US
 * company is such a supply. Refusing every non-zero rate for these customers
 * makes those invoices impossible to issue at all. Because the exceptions span
 * 25%, 12% and 6%, no single non-zero rate can be whitelisted instead.
 *
 * Nothing on an invoice line distinguishes "consulting for a German company"
 * (0%, reverse charge) from "hotel night in Stockholm sold to a German company"
 * (12% Swedish VAT), so this set only widens what is ACCEPTED. The default stays
 * 0% via getAvailableVatRates() and getVatRules().rate, which is also the
 * fallback when a line omits vat_rate. A Swedish rate therefore lands on such an
 * invoice only when it was set explicitly on that line.

 * The customer record is the right default for services: a B2B service is
 * taxed where the buyer is established (huvudregeln, ML 6 kap.), which is
 * what the customer row describes. It is the wrong source for goods, whose
 * exemptions (export, unionsintern leverans, ML 10 kap.) turn on where the
 * goods are transported: a Swedish company buying goods shipped to Norway
 * is an export (ruta 36) although the buyer is Swedish. So the one fact an
 * invoice can add is where the goods go, and a set delivery_country
 * declares the invoice a supply of goods:
 *
 *  - standard: Swedish VAT at the line rates (ruta 05), always allowed. The
 *    conservative choice, e.g. goods without export evidence, or a distance
 *    sale to a consumer in another member state under the OSS threshold.
 *  - export with delivery_country: export of goods (0 %, 3105, ruta 36),
 *    only when the country is outside the EU goods VAT area.
 *  - reverse_charge with delivery_country: unionsintern leverans (0 %, 3108,
 *    ruta 35), only to another member state and only with the buyer's VAT
 *    number from a member state other than Sweden, VIES-validated
 *    (ML 10 kap. 42-43 §§, a material condition). Printed on the invoice
 *    (ML 17 kap. 24 § p.4), so never for a private person, whose number the
 *    PDF withholds.
 *  - export / reverse_charge without delivery_country: the services
 *    treatment (3305 ruta 40 / 3308 ruta 39), accepted only where the
 *    customer already gets it. For anyone else the only lawful 0 % route is
 *    goods with a destination, so the caller is told to name it.
 *  - delivery_country alone: the treatment the destination implies, then
 *    the same checks.
 *
 * The seller's VAT registration is the caller's gate, as for getVatRules().
