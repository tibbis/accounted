/**
 * The customer's share of an invoice: ONE definition.
 *
 * Under ROT/RUT fakturamodellen the company invoices the full amount and the
 * customer pays the total minus the skattereduktion; the deduction is a
 * fordran on Skatteverket carried on 1513, never on the customer
 * (swedish-invoice-compliance, invoice-rules.md section 8). Every settlement
 * path records the customer share as the payment row amount, so "what is
 * still outstanding" must be measured against that share.
 *
 * This arithmetic used to be re-derived by hand at every reader and one copy
 * drifted (#2248: the kontantmetod cut-off compared payments against the
 * gross total). It now lives here and in exactly one SQL twin:
 *
 *   invoices_derive_remaining_amount (migrations 20260817191708, 20260907160000)
 *   remaining_amount = GREATEST(0, ROUND(total - paid_amount - deduction_total
 *                                        + deduction_reclaimed_total, 2))
 *
 * deduction_reclaimed_total is the part of the deduction Skatteverket refused
 * and that a rot_rut_reclaim voucher moved back onto the customer (debit 1510
 * / credit 1513): from then on it IS the customer's to pay, while the invoice
 * document keeps the deduction it was issued with.
 *
 * Change both or neither. The guard floors at zero because it persists the
 * column; the functions here return the signed value and each writer applies
 * the floor it needs (payment-sync mirrors GREATEST(0, ...), the kontantmetod
 * cut-off floors on the invoice's own side so credit notes keep their sign).
