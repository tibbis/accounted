/**
 * Shared helpers for invoice PDF render call sites.
 *
 * Two responsibilities:
 *   1. Build the branding object from company settings.
 *   2. Resolve the company logo into a format @react-pdf/renderer can draw.
 *
 * The payment QR code is resolved and drawn by the render entry point,
 * lib/invoices/render-invoice-pdf.ts, which every invoice render goes
 * through.
 *
 * Why the logo needs resolving (issue #772: "Logotyp kommer inte med på
 * fakturor"): @react-pdf/renderer's <Image> only decodes JPG and PNG, but the
 * logo upload route and the `logos` storage bucket both accept SVG and WebP.
 * When the logo is an SVG/WebP, @react-pdf fails to decode it and *silently*
 * swallows the error (a console.warn inside a try/catch in its fetchImage step):
 * so the invoice renders fine but with no logo, and nothing surfaces.
 *
 * Fix: fetch the stored logo and re-encode it to a PNG data URL via sharp, then
 * hand the template a company whose `logo_url` is that data URL. This makes the
 * logo render regardless of the uploaded format and removes the render-time
 * dependency on a remote fetch succeeding inside @react-pdf.
