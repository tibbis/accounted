/**
 * The single writer of invoice_payments rows (the customer AR sub-ledger).
 *
 * Every settlement path records its payment here: "Markera som betald"
 * (dashboard, v1, MCP), the Stripe payment sync, the bank match (dashboard,
 * v1, pending-operation commit) and the link-to-existing-voucher flow.
 * `npm run check:guards` (direct-invoice-payment-insert) refuses a
 * `.from('invoice_payments').insert(` anywhere else under app/, lib/ or
 * extensions/, so the row's field semantics cannot drift per code path
 * again: five hand-built inserts each computed their own `amount`, and the
 * bank-match ones stored the cash received (#2250).
 *
 * Without the row the payment has no DATE anywhere. The kontantmetod bokslut
 * cut-off (lib/core/bookkeeping/kontantmetod-cutoff.ts) reads invoice_payments
 * only and would book a paid invoice as a fordran with vilande moms at year
 * end, double-counting revenue and VAT (#2019); the Betalningar view and the
 * voucher -> invoice reference map read the same table.
 *
 * `amount` is the amount APPLIED to the invoice (new paid_amount minus the
 * prior one), in INVOICE currency, never the cash received: a SEK
 * öresavrundning overshoot absorbed on 3740 is part of the voucher but not
 * of the receivable, and every reader subtracts rows from `total`. The
 * (transaction_id, invoice_id) unique index treats nulls as distinct, so
 * several manual partials on one invoice coexist; (journal_entry_id,
 * invoice_id) still refuses the same voucher twice.
