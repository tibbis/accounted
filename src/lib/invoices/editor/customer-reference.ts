/**
 * Er referens follows the customer card's contact person until the user

 *
 *  - An empty field takes the picked customer's contact person.
 *  - A value the editor filled in itself is replaced when the customer
 *    changes (or cleared when the new one has no contact person), so a
 *    switch never leaves the previous customer's person on the invoice.
 *  - Anything else in the field was typed by the user, or came from a copy
 *    or a saved draft: it is never overwritten.
 *
 * Pure: the editor keeps `prefilled` between customer changes.
