/**
 * Coverage of the invoice register (the `invoices` table) relative to the

 * Accounted: a company migrated mid-year (SIE import) or backfilled through
 * manual/API verifikat has real customer invoices that exist ONLY as journal
 * entries. Every surface that answers "which invoices do we have" from the
 * register alone looks complete while silently omitting that period; this
 * helper computes the disclosure those surfaces show.
 *
 * Detection is AR-based, not import-based: `fetchMigrationCoverageEnd()`
 * keys on source_type='import', which misses invoice history recreated as
 * plain manual verifikat (the 2026-09-01 user report: a full spring of
 * "Kundfakturor" with source_type='manual'). An invoice booked as a
 * verifikat DEBITS the receivable on 1510/1513, so posted pre-boundary AR
 * debit lines from outside the invoice engine are the signal. Credits are
 * deliberately not counted (a manually booked advance payment before the
 * first invoice credits 1510 and says nothing about register coverage), and
 * every invoice-engine source type is excluded, storno/correction included:
 * a rättelse of an engine entry may be re-dated before the boundary
 * (storno-service newEntryDate) and must not flag its own register invoice
 * as external. Kontantmetod invoice history booked straight against 1930
 * stays undetected; accepted, because widening to all class-3 revenue would
 * flag cash sales (webshop orders, kassa) that were never register material.
 *
 * The probe is driven from journal_entries (company-indexed) with the line
 * condition as an inner embed, never from journal_entry_lines with entry
 * filters on the embed: that inverted shape compiles to a lateral scan of
 * the whole lines table across tenants (see lib/bookkeeping/entry-lines.ts).
