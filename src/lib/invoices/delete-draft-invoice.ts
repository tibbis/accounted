/**
 * Draft customer-invoice deletion, shared by the cookie-session route
 * (DELETE /api/invoices/[id]), the v1 API-key route
 * (DELETE /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/invoices/{id}) and the MCP
 * delete_draft_invoice executor.
 *
 * Behaviour depends on whether an F-series number was issued:
 *
 *  - Unnumbered draft (saved via "Spara som utkast", never finalized): hard
 *    deleted. No F-series number was consumed, so there is no gap to document
 *    (ML 17 kap 24 paragraf). invoice_items cascade via the FK.
 *  - Numbered draft (created directly, or finalized via "Granska och skapa"):
 *    makulerad: the row and its number are retained and status flips to
 *    'cancelled', keeping the F-series gap-free per ML 17 kap 24 paragraf /
 *    BFNAR 2013:2.
 *
 * Only drafts may be removed either way. Sent / paid invoices are immutable
 * per BFL and must be reversed via a credit note instead. Posted journal
 * entries and documents linked to them are never touched here: a draft has
 * neither.
 *
 * The actor is an EXPLICIT parameter: v1 and MCP callers run on the
 * service-role client, where auth.uid() is null, so the caller's user id can
 * never be inferred from the client.
