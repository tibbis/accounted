/**
 * Apply an edit to a recurring invoice schedule: the header fields first, then
 * a full replace of its items (delete everything, reinsert the new set with
 * `schedule_id` stamped on).
 *
 * Neither write is atomic over PostgREST, and a combined edit touches two
 * tables, so BOTH writes are compensated on failure:
 *   - the items are snapshotted before the delete and best-effort reinserted
 *     when the insert fails (without that, a rejected insert leaves the
 *     schedule with ZERO items and every cron run throws "schedule has no
 *     items", silently skipping billing dates), and
 *   - the header fields are snapshotted before the update and rolled back to
 *     their previous values, so an item failure cannot leave a half-applied
 *     edit (a new day_of_month kept while the line edit was undone).
 *
 * Same snapshot/restore idiom as replaceInvoiceItems in
 * lib/invoices/replace-invoice-items.ts. `itemsRestored` / `headerRestored` on
 * the failure shapes say whether the schedule is back in its prior state; when
 * either is false the caller must tell the user the schedule may be partially
 * saved instead of reporting a clean failure.
 *
 * No destructive write happens once its compensating snapshot is known to be
 * unavailable: an unreadable header snapshot fails before the header UPDATE,
 * and an unreadable item snapshot fails before the DELETE (rolling the header
 * back). That is what keeps the cron invariant "a schedule always has items"
 * true on EVERY failure path, not just the ones where the restore succeeded.
 *
 * Tenancy: `recurring_invoice_schedule_items` has no company_id, so the item
 * DELETE/INSERT can only be scoped by `schedule_id`, and the commit executor
 * runs this on a service-role client with RLS off. The helper therefore proves
 * ownership itself: whenever `items` is provided it first reads the header row
 * filtered by BOTH id and company_id, and a miss aborts before anything is
 * written. Callers should still 404 on their own beforehand (they own the
 * user-facing not-found shape), but a caller that forgets cannot reach another
 * tenant's rows through here.
 *
 * Shared by the cookie PATCH route (app/api/invoices/recurring/[id]) and the
 * update_recurring_schedule commit executor so the two surfaces cannot drift.
