 * Every height here is a reservation: the page padding keeps the flow out of
 * the running header and the footer, and the spacer at the end of the totals
 * block keeps it out of the payment area. Nothing in a zone depends on the
 * invoice's status or the company's settings, so a paid re-render paginates
 * exactly like the original and a long invoice never puts the payment area
 * on a page without its totals.
