/**
 * ROT/RUT payout matching: suggest the open begäran om utbetalning that an
 * income bank row from Skatteverket settles.
 *
 * Why the payout REQUEST and not the invoice: under fakturamodellen the
 * customer pays their share (settles the invoice, remaining_amount is stored
 * net of the deduction) and Skatteverket's share sits on BAS 1513 until the
 * agency pays out one lump sum per begäran, which may cover several invoices.
 * The invoice is therefore already `paid` when the SKV money lands and can
 * never be a match candidate; the request is the thing that still has an
 * outstanding balance.
 *
 * Confidence ladder (mirrors supplier-invoice-matching.ts):
 *   exact amount + Skatteverket named in description/merchant   -> 0.95
 *   exact amount only                                            -> 0.85
 * Two open requests with the same amount are ambiguous: no suggestion. There
 * is no fuzzy amount pass on purpose: Skatteverket pays exactly the decided
 * sum, so a near-miss is not this request.
 *
 * No server-only imports on purpose (only lib/money): client components
 * import the target-state helper too.
