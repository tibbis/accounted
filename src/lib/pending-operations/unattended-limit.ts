/**
 * Approval-authority limit: what an API key may commit WITHOUT a human.
 *
 * This is not a write limit. Over the ceiling the operation stays staged and a
 * person approves it in /pending, so nothing is destroyed, no voucher number is
 * burned, and no löpnummer gap appears (BFL 5 kap. 7 §).
 *
 * ## What this control is, and is not
 *
 * It is a blast-radius cap on an agent that is looping, mis-prompted or
 * prompt-injected. It is NOT a security boundary: a per-entry ceiling is
 * defeated by splitting one large entry into several small ones, and an LLM
 * will discover that on its own, because "reduce the amount and retry" is the
 * obvious repair for "amount too large".
 *
 * That bypass is itself a compliance violation, since one affärshändelse is one
 * verifikat (BFL 5 kap. 6 §), which is why the UNATTENDED_COMMIT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
 * remediation tells the agent not to split BEFORE it tells it anything else.
 * A rolling-window cumulative limit is the primitive that actually bounds
 * exposure; it is deliberately a separate change.

/**
 * Every operation type that posts money, with the preview_data field carrying
 * the amount it will post.
 *
 * An explicit allowlist, and every entry is verified against production rather
 * than guessed. Over the last 120 days each field below is present and numeric
 * on 100% of that type's staged rows:
 *
 *   create_voucher                    total_debit         1389 rows
 *   categorize_transaction            amount              2003 rows
 *   create_supplier_invoice_from_inbox total               228 rows
 *   link_transaction_journal_entry    transaction_amount  1369 rows
 *   bulk_book_transactions            tx_sum               273 rows
 *   link_supplier_invoice_voucher     payment_amount        55 rows
 *   match_batch_allocate              total_allocated       24 rows
 *   mark_invoice_paid                 total                  3 rows
 *
 * The staged preview already carries the amount the operation intends to post,
 * because that is the number a human is shown when approving it. An earlier
 * draft of this file assumed the batch and settlement paths computed their
 * totals only inside SQL at dispatch and therefore left them unpriced; that was
 * wrong, and it left the four largest settlement paths able to post any amount
 * on a key with a ceiling.
 *
 * Types deliberately absent, and why:
 *   - reconciliation_match carries pair_count, a COUNT, not an amount. Pricing
 *     it off that number would compare pairs against kronor. It stays unpriced.
 *   - link_document_to_voucher and attach_document_to_transaction move no
 *     money; they attach räkenskapsinformation to something already booked.
 *   - create_customer, create_transaction and the rest of the registry post
 *     nothing to the ledger.
 *
 * Anything not listed is unpriceable and FAILS OPEN. That is the safe direction
 * for a control that can only ever narrow what a key does: a wrong guess at an
 * amount blocks a legitimate commit, and the failure mode of guessing high is
 * an agent that cannot work at all.
