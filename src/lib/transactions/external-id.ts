/**
 * Shared helpers for deriving stable bank-transaction `external_id`s and for
 * normalizing monetary amounts used in dedup keys.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * The transactions table is deduplicated on `(company_id, external_id)` (a
 * partial unique index, see migration 20260330130000). The dedup is therefore
 * only as good as the stability of `external_id` across re-syncs.
 *
 * For Enable Banking (PSD2 / Berlin Group) the previous scheme keyed
 * `external_id` off the bank's `entry_reference` / `transaction_id`
 * (`eb_{account}_{tx.id}`). Many Swedish ASPSPs do NOT return those fields
 * stably across requests: a later "synka nu" can return the same underlying
 * transaction with a different id, which produced a *new* `external_id` and
 * therefore a duplicate row (including for transactions the user had already
 * booked). See `buildStableExternalIds` for the content-derived replacement.
 */

/**
 * Normalize a monetary amount to integer öre (hundredths) for stable,
 * representation-agnostic comparison.
 *
 * PostgREST may return a `numeric` column as a JS number OR as a string
 * (preserving precision), so `1234.5` and the string `"1234.50"` can describe
 * the same amount. Interpolating either directly into a dedup key yields
 * different strings (`"1234.5"` vs `"1234.50"`), silently breaking content
 * dedup. Rounding to integer öre collapses both to `123450`.
 *
 * Uses the project-standard `Math.round(x * 100)` (never `toFixed`).

/**
 * Build stable, collision-safe `external_id`s for a batch of bank transactions
 * whose provider does not supply a reliable stable id (e.g. Enable Banking).
 *
 * The id is derived from content: `{prefix}_{accountScope}_{date}_{öre}_{n}`,
 * where `n` is an occurrence index that disambiguates genuinely identical
 * transactions (same account, date and amount) within the batch.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE FORMAT STRING IS A STORED KEY. It is persisted to
 * `transactions.external_id` and dedup compares incoming ids against the stored
 * ones byte-for-byte. Changing this template silently orphans every prior row
 * (its stored id no longer matches the new scheme) and re-imports them all on
 * the next sync: this is exactly what happened in the June 2026 fleet-wide
 * incident. Any format change MUST ship a coordinated backfill of existing rows
 * and is locked by a frozen-format test (see `external-id.test.ts`).
 *
 * Properties this guarantees:
 * - **Re-sync dedupe**: the same set of transactions produces the same *set*
 *   of ids regardless of the order the ASPSP returns them in, so a repeat sync
 *   collides with the existing rows on `(company_id, external_id)` and is
 *   skipped, even after the user has booked them. (The id *set* is what the
 *   unique index enforces; which physical row maps to `..._0` vs `..._1` need
 *   not be stable, only the set.)
 * - **No false dedupe**: two legitimately distinct transactions that share a
 *   date and amount get different ids (`..._0`, `..._1`) and are both kept.
 *   This is the safeguard the bank-file importer already relies on via its
 *   `rowIndex` component (see `lib/import/bank-file/parser.ts`).
 *
 * Why description is NOT an input here (but IS in the content bridge): the
 * `external_id` must be a *stable unique key*, so it cannot depend on a field
 * that drifts: PSD2 enriches/reorders descriptions between a transaction's
 * pending and booked states. The occurrence index gives uniqueness without
 * that fragility. The content bridge (`contentBucketKey` + `descriptionsBridge`)
 * has the opposite job: it is a best-effort *bridge* that must avoid dropping
 * real transactions, so it keeps the description (see those for the trade-off).
 *
 * @param prefix       Source tag, e.g. `'eb'` for Enable Banking.
 * @param accountScope Stable per-account scope (prefer IBAN, fall back to the
 *                     provider account uid). Keeps ids unique across accounts.
 *                     Callers should pass a whitespace/case-normalized IBAN so
 *                     formatting variants ("SE45 5000…" vs "SE455000…") don't
 *                     produce different ids for the same account.
 * @param txns         Batch in provider order; each needs `date` + `amount`.
