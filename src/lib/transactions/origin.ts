/**
 * Transaction origin helpers: distinguish rows the user created INSIDE the app
 * from rows that were fetched/imported from an external feed (bank sync or a
 * bank-file upload).
 *
 * Why this matters
 * ----------------
 * An imported row is an external system's record of money that actually moved.
 * The user may *ignore* it (`is_ignored`) to take it off the to-book /
 * reconciliation lists, but must never be able to *delete* it: deleting would
 * silently drop a real bank line, and the next sync (or a re-import of the same
 * file) would either bring it back as a "new" row or, worse, leave the books
 * out of step with the bank. Only hand-entered rows are the user's to remove.
 *
 * The two import paths that populate `transactions` from outside the app:
 *   - Enable Banking (PSD2) live sync → sets `bank_connection_id`
 *     (and `import_source = 'enable_banking'`). See
 *     `extensions/general/enable-banking/lib/sync.ts`.
 *   - Bank-file import (CSV / CAMT053) → sets `import_source` to `'camt053'` or
 *     `'csv_<format>'` (no live connection). See
 *     `app/api/import/bank-file/execute/route.ts`.
 *
 * Everything else is user-created and therefore deletable (subject to the
 * separate "booked rows are immutable" rule):
 *   - manual add via POST /api/transactions      → `import_source = null`
 *   - legacy create-from-document rows            → `import_source = 'manual'`
 *   - MCP / agent create                          → `import_source = 'mcp'`
 *
 * Safe-by-default: this is an ALLOWLIST of known user-created sources. Any other
 * `import_source` tag (including an import feed added in the future) is
 * treated as imported (ignore-only), so a new feed can never accidentally
 * become user-deletable before someone consciously adds it here.
