/**
 * Re-anchor a supplier invoice's retained source document to one of the
 * invoice's own posted verifikat when the document is currently floating
 * (document_attachments.journal_entry_id IS NULL).
 *
 * Why this exists (support case 2026-07-27): every missing-underlag surface
 * (verifikat_without_documents / transactions_without_documents RPCs,
 * /api/documents/counts, the transactions list) only accepts a referenced
 * supplier-invoice document as underlag when it is ANCHORED to a journal
 * entry, because only anchored docs sit behind the WORM deletion guards
 * (block_document_deletion keys on journal_entry_id). A floating document
 * therefore keeps "Underlag saknas" alive on a verifikat that plainly shows
 * the invoice PDF, and the user has no way to resolve it: the nag is supposed
 * to get the document anchored, but nothing anchored it.
 *
 * Documents end up floating two ways, both seen in production:
 *   1. delete_last_voucher clears journal_entry_id on every document hanging
 *      on the deleted voucher (it has to: the FK is ON DELETE RESTRICT). When
 *      that voucher was a rättelse the invoice's PDF had been relinked onto,
 *      the invoice is left holding an unanchored document while its payment
 *      verifikat is still posted.
 *   2. Payment/cash verifikat booked for an invoice whose document was never
 *      anchored at registration (attached after the fact, or booked through a
 *      path that did not link it).
 *
 * Anchoring is strictly an improvement: it puts the document behind the
 * deletion guard and makes the hänvisning (BFL 5 kap 7 §) legally solid, and
 * the immutability triggers explicitly allow NULL -> uuid
 * (enforce_document_journal_entry_immutability returns early when
 * OLD.journal_entry_id IS NULL). An already-anchored document is never moved.
 *
 * Returns the journal entry id the document was anchored to, or null when
 * nothing needed doing (no document, already anchored, no eligible verifikat).
 * Never throws: every caller runs after a committed, immutable booking, so a
 * failure here must be logged, not surfaced.
