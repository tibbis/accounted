/**
 * An operation is one thing a user can do to their books (create a
 * dimension, register a supplier invoice, lock a period), defined ONCE and
 * served through every machine door:
 *
 *   - v1 REST: `v1OperationHandler(op)` in lib/operations/v1.ts, which also
 *     registers the endpoint so it appears in /api/v1/openapi.json;
 *   - MCP: `createOperationTools()` in the MCP extension turns every
 *     operation with an `mcp` binding into a tool (reads run directly,
 *     writes stage a pending operation that a human approves);
 *   - the staged-operation commit path: `commitPendingOperation` runs the
 *     same `run()` for an approved pending operation of `mcp.stage.pendingType`.
 *
 * The dashboard's session routes call the same service functions the
 * operation wraps, so the UI and the API cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Why this exists: before it, each capability was written three or four
 * times (a dashboard route, a v1 route, an MCP tool with a hand-written JSON
 * schema, a commit executor), and the copies drifted: fields validated and
 * then dropped, guards present on one door only, a 1000-row cap fixed in one
 * copy of a list and not the other. The request contract, the rules and the
 * outcome now live in one place and the doors only translate envelopes.
 *
 * Authorization: every door establishes that the caller is a non-viewer
 * member of the company, and nothing more. v1 and MCP run on a service-role
 * client where RLS does not apply, so an operation whose writes the
 * dashboard reserves for owners and admins must call requireCompanyAdmin
 * (./access.ts) in its service, on a dry run too.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: anything the scope catalogue, the risk tiers and
 * the approval vocabulary hold. Those are client-imported data tables, so
 * they stay tables, and operation-contract.test.ts checks that every
 * operation is present in them with the same scope and risk.
