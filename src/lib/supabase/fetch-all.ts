/**
 * Fetches all rows from a Supabase query by paginating through results.
 * Overcomes PostgREST's default 1000-row limit.
 *
 * **Ordering invariant:** any query that can return more than `PAGE_SIZE` rows
 * MUST `.order()` on a unique column (e.g. the table's `id` PK). Postgres
 * returns rows in an undefined order that can differ between the two `.range()`
 * requests, so without a stable total order, rows on a page boundary are
 * silently DUPLICATED and/or SKIPPED across pages. For aggregating reports
 * (general ledger, trial balance, grundbok) that means doubled or missing
 * balances. Order is purely for paging stability: callers that need a
 * different display order should re-sort after fetching.
 *
 * The callback receives `{ from, to }` range values: append `.range(from, to)`
 * to your query builder, AFTER a stable `.order()`:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const accounts = await fetchAllRows(({ from, to }) =>
 *   supabase
 *     .from('chart_of_accounts')
 *     .select('account_number, account_name')
 *     .eq('company_id', companyId)
 *     .order('account_number', { ascending: true }) // stable total order
 *     .range(from, to)
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * Pass `{ dedupeBy }` as defense-in-depth for queries where a missing/regressed
 * order would corrupt money:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const lines = await fetchAllRows(
 *   ({ from, to }) => q.order('id').range(from, to),
 *   { dedupeBy: (r) => r.id },
 * )
 * ```
