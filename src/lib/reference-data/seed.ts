/**
 * Server-to-client seed for the reference-data cache.
 *
 * The dashboard layout already fetches company settings for its own nav;
 * adding the (small) fiscal-period and cash-account lists to that batch and
 * handing all three to SWR as `fallback` means the first form a user opens
 * renders its period, bank-account and settings-driven fields on the first
 * paint with zero client round trips. SWR consults `fallback` only while
 * the cache has no entry for the key, so after the first background
 * revalidation or any mutate() the live cache wins; a hard reload re-seeds.
 *
 * Keys are serialized with SWR's own `unstable_serialize` and built from
 * `refKeys`, so the seed can never drift from the hooks (pinned by a test).
