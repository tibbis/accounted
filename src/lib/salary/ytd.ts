/**
 * Year-to-date (ackumulerat) totals for an employee's payslips.
 *
 * `salary_run_employees.ytd_gross/ytd_tax/ytd_net` is the "Ackumulerat
 * {år}" block on the lönespecifikation. It is a stored snapshot, not a
 * derived value: once written it stays put, so an employee who re-opens a
 * payslip months later sees the same figures the PDF had when it was
 * issued.
 *
 * The snapshot is written first at calculation time (run-calculation.ts) and
 * then REFRESHED at every step that freezes the run's own figures: approval
 * (the first status from which payslips can be sent) and booking. Without
 * that refresh the snapshot silently rots: preparing next month's run before
 * the current one is booked (entirely normal) captures a YTD that is missing
 * the month in between, and nothing ever recomputes it.
 *
 * YTD is payslip display + reporting only. Per-month tax-table lookup and
 * the per-month arbetsgivaravgifter caps never read it, so a refresh can
 * never move a booked verifikation: it only corrects what the employee is
 * shown.
