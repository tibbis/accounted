 *   daily divisor  : monthly salary -> daily rate (sick/VAB/parental
 *                    deductions, sammalöneregeln day valuation)
 *
 * BACKWARD-COMPAT CONTRACT (deliberate discontinuity): at the DEFAULT
 * schedule (40h / 5d) these return the legacy constants 173 and 21, not the
 * exact formulas (which give 173.33 and 21.67). Switching the defaults to
 * exact formulas would change every running company's monthly-to-hourly
 * derivation by ~0.2% and every sick/VAB daily deduction by ~3% mid-year
 * with zero schedule change, which is indefensible in a payroll product.
 * Non-default schedules use the exact formula: they have no legacy results
 * to preserve. Migrating the defaults to exact formulas is deferred to a
 * fiscal-year boundary with release notes.
