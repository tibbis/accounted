/**
 * Find a free BAS class-19 slot for a new PSD2 cash account, respecting the
 * UNIQUE (company_id, ledger_account) constraint. A bank returning N
 * same-currency accounts must not map them all to the currency default —
 * that's exactly the collision this prevents.
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - The currency default (1930/1932/1933/1934) is available when no row
 *     holds it, or when its holder can be promoted in place to the incoming
 *     account (holderAdoptableBy, the database's own rule): no live
 *     connection syncs onto it, same currency, and no IBAN or the same one.
 *     The seeded 1930 row (no IBAN) is taken over that way. Rows held by a
 *     REVOKED connection count as manual too: disconnecting a bank releases
 *     its ledger claims, so reconnecting the same bank gets its original
 *     slot back instead of overflowing to 1939. A manual or revoked holder
 *     with ANOTHER IBAN is a different bank account (a personal account left
 *     from an earlier connection, say): the database refuses to promote it,
 *     so the account overflows instead of failing the whole connection.
 *     `options.iban` is the incoming account's IBAN; omitted, it counts as
 *     an account without one, which never takes over a holder that has one.
 *   - Overflow walks the free-use 1931–1959 sub-account slots, skipping the
 *     four currency defaults (reserved as suggestions for their currencies)
 *     and any slot held by ANY existing row — promoting an unrelated manual
 *     account (SIE-imported, kassa) would silently steal it.
 *   - Overflow ALSO skips 19xx numbers that already exist in the company's
 *     chart of accounts, even when no cash_accounts row holds them. A chart
 *     imported from SIE carries the company's real bank accounts by name
 *     ("1942 Nordnet", "1938 Danske eSett Settlement") without any PSD2 row
 *     behind them, and handing one of those out as "free" is how a SEK
 *     företagskonto ended up proposed as 1942 Nordnet. Only when every
 *     chart-free slot is exhausted do we fall back to chart-occupied numbers,
 *     so a company with a fully populated 19xx chart still gets an answer.
 *   - `exclude` carries slots already assigned earlier in the caller's loop
 *     but not yet visible in the table.
 *
 * Returns null when no slot is free (or the lookup fails) — callers fall back
 * to their previous behavior and surface the error.

 * they hold for every caller and cannot go stale between check and write:
 *   - never a row a bank connection holds (bank_connection_id set). Its flag
 *     mirrors bank_connections.accounts_data[].enabled, which is also what the
 *     sync reads; upsertFromPsd2 rewrites it from there. Flipping only this
 *     copy would hide an account that keeps syncing, or show one the picker
 *     turned off because another company claims it.
 *   - never disable the primary: getPrimary() does not filter on enabled, so
 *     the __PRIMARY_SEK__ counter account would keep routing to a hidden row.
 *
 * Returns null when no row qualified; the caller re-reads to say why. Open
 * transactions are the caller's check (hasOpenTransactions): they live in
 * another table, and ensureManualCashAccount re-enables on the ingest side.
