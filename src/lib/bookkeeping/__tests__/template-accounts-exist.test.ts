/**
 * Every account a booking template names must exist in BAS 2026.
 *
 * This is not pedantry: `lib/bookkeeping/account-backfill.ts` seeds a missing
 * account into a company's chart on demand ONLY if it appears in
 * BAS_REFERENCE. An account that does not is unreachable, so the template
 * fails with AccountsNotInChartError every single time it is used, for every
 * company. It is a template that can never work.
 *
 * Three shipped templates were in exactly that state until this test existed:
 *   vehicle_parking    5614  (the BAS 561x run skips 5614)
 *   it_cloud_hosting   5421  (BAS has 5420 Programvaror, no 5421)
 *   preliminar-f-skatt-ef  2012  (found separately by the pack validator)
 *
 * The pack catalogue gets this check from `scripts/validate-packs.ts`. The
 * static registry had nothing, which is why it drifted.
