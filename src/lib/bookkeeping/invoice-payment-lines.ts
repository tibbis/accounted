/**
 * Builds the journal-entry lines for the clearing entry that closes (fully
 * or partially) a customer invoice against an actual bank transaction.
 *
 * The lines built here are the "Inbetalning kundfaktura" path under
 * faktureringsmetoden (accrual): Dr 1930 / Cr 1510, with a 3960/7960
 * FX-diff line when the invoice and the bank tx are in different currencies.
 *
 * Shared between:
 *   - GET /api/transactions/[id]/match-invoice/preview (read-only, drives
 *     the dialog the user confirms against)
 *   - POST /api/transactions/[id]/match-invoice (the commit path)
 *
 * Single source of truth so the preview and the committed verifikat are
 * byte-identical. Earlier the two diverged on the cross-currency math:
 * the preview ran `resolveSekAmount(tx.amount, null, INV.currency, INV.rate)`,
 * treating the SEK tx number as if it were in the invoice's currency and
 * multiplying by the invoice's stored rate. That produced a fictitious
 * bank-leg amount and silently dropped the FX gain/loss.
 *
 * # Customer-invoice only
 *
 * This helper is the CUSTOMER side (kundfaktura): AR account 1510, FX gain
 * 3960 (valutakursvinster rörelsefordringar), FX loss 7960
 * (valutakursförluster rörelsefordringar), bank-leg = Dr. Supplier-side
 * settlement has the opposite DR/CR polarity (Cr 1930 / Dr 2440-series) and
 * a different account taxonomy; it lives in the match_batch_allocate RPC,
 * not here. Do not call this helper from supplier-invoice flows.
 *
 * # Currency model
 *
 *   tx.currency      : currency of the bank tx (almost always SEK)
 *   tx.amount        : amount in tx.currency
 *   tx.exchange_rate : populated at ingest only when tx.currency != SEK
 *   tx.amount_sek    : pre-computed SEK at ingest for non-SEK tx
 *   invoice.currency : currency the invoice was issued in
 *   invoice.exchange_rate: the rate at which AR was originally booked on 1510.
 *                     REQUIRED whenever the invoice is foreign, regardless of
 *                     the bank tx currency: without it the SEK value of the
 *                     receivable was never established, so the kursvinst /
 *                     kursförlust on settlement is not computable and the
 *                     helper throws InvoiceBookingRateMissingError rather than
 *                     inventing a number. Never needed for a SEK invoice.
 *
 *   Bank-leg (1930) = always the actual SEK that hit the bank.
 *   AR-leg (1510)   = the SEK value of the customer-debt reduction at the
 *                     INVOICE's stored rate (capped to bankSek on partials
 *                     to keep 1510 in sync with invoice.remaining_amount).
 *   FX diff         = (AR-leg SEK − Bank-leg SEK); sign drives 3960 vs 7960.
 *                     Per BFL 5 kap 4-5§ every verifikat must balance to the
 *                     öre; the FX diff line is what makes the cross-currency
 *                     verifikat balance. Only emitted when the bank tx fully
 *                     clears the invoice's remaining: partials defer the
 *                     FX adjustment to the final settlement to avoid
 *                     prematurely zeroing 1510 while the AR row still says
 *                     partially_paid.

 *   arSek = bankSek here (the pre-fix behaviour) over/under-credited 1510 by
 *   the whole rate movement and stranded the realized kursdiff on the balance
 *   sheet instead of the P&L.
 *
 * # Cross-currency with explicit paidInInvoiceCurrency (preferred path)
 *   The caller supplies how many units of the invoice's currency this bank
 *   payment satisfies (typically computed as `bankSek / today_rate` where
 *   `today_rate` is the Riksbanken spot rate on the payment date: see
 *   `app/api/transactions/[id]/match-invoice/route.ts`). The helper then:

 *     fxDiffSek = arSek − bankSek
 *   For a partial cross-currency payment this credits 1510 by the
 *   proportional foreign amount (not the full remaining) and posts the
 *   accurate FX-diff line. The verifikat balances per BFL 5 kap 4-5§ and
 *   the GL stays in sync with the AR sub-ledger because both move in step.
 *
 * # Cross-currency without paidInInvoiceCurrency (fallback)
 *   Earlier behaviour, kept for callers that haven't been updated yet:
 *   if `bankSek >= remaining × rate`, book the full FX diff (full clear);
 *   otherwise defer (book 1930 = 1510 = bankSek with no FX line). The
 *   deferred path leaves the GL slightly understated until the final
 *   settlement closes the invoice.
 *
 * # Foreign invoice with no booking rate
 *   Throws InvoiceBookingRateMissingError (code
 *   MATCH_INVOICE_BOOKING_RATE_MISSING). Every foreign-invoice path above
 *   (same-currency foreign and both cross-currency paths) values the AR leg
 *   at the invoice's booking rate; without it the SEK value of the receivable
 *   is unknown and the kursvinst/kursförlust is not a computable number. The
 *   caller must obtain the rate the invoice was booked at instead of posting
 *   a guess. Only a SEK invoice can never throw: it is settled entirely by
 *   the SEK branches and never consults invoice.exchange_rate.
 *
 * # paymentAccount
 *   The bank-leg account (the debit line below). Defaults to '1930': callers
 *   that haven't resolved the transaction's actual cash account keep booking
 *   there unchanged. Callers matching a real bank transaction should resolve
 *   it via resolveSettlementAccount (cash_account_id -> cash_accounts.ledger_
 *   account) and pass it here so a receipt into a non-primary bank/cash
 *   account (e.g. a secondary SEK account, or a EUR account on 1940) doesn't
