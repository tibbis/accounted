/**
 * Which single ledger line carries a manual entry's FX metadata.
 *
 * `journal_entry_lines.debit_amount / credit_amount` are ALWAYS SEK. A foreign
 * affärshändelse is converted to SEK for those columns, and the foreign figure
 * survives only as `currency` + `amount_in_currency` + `exchange_rate` stamped
 * onto ONE leg: the leg that is the foreign monetary item. That is the ÅRL
 * 4 kap. 13 § line: fordringar och skulder i utländsk valuta are what gets
 * revalued at balansdagens kurs, while a maskin, ett lager or en kostnad is
 * measured once in SEK and never revalued.
 *
 * THE GENERATORS ARE THE REFERENCE. Each puts the metadata on exactly one leg,
 * the monetary item carrying the whole document amount:
 *   lib/bookkeeping/invoice-entries.ts          → 1510, amount = invoice.total
 *   lib/bookkeeping/supplier-invoice-entries.ts → 2440, amount = invoice.total
 *   lib/bookkeeping/transaction-entries.ts      → the settlement/cash leg,
 *                                                 amount = |transaction.amount|
 * Never on a VAT leg, never on a P&L leg, never on two legs at once. Note that
 * the account prefix is NOT the rule: 1510, 2440 and 19xx all appear.
 *
 * Everything that reads the metadata back finds the line BY ACCOUNT and then
 * trusts the label, so a misplaced stamp is not cosmetic:
 *   lib/reconciliation/bank-reconciliation.ts `ledgerLineAmountIn()` reconciles
 *     a foreign cash account against `amount_in_currency` on that account's own
 *     lines. Metadata on the SEK leg instead leaves the EUR account with no
 *     comparable figure at all, and labels a SEK movement as a EUR one.
 *   lib/invoices/voucher-matching.ts narrows candidate vouchers with
 *     `journal_entry_lines.currency = invoice.currency` under the 1510/2440
 *     prefix: the metadata has to be on that leg or the voucher is invisible.
 *   lib/core/bookkeeping/storno-service.ts mirrors whatever is stored, so a
 *     wrong stamp is copied into the rättelse as well.
 *
 * This module is pure and order-independent on purpose: the caller resolves the
 * slot in a PRE-PASS over all lines and only then builds them, so the answer
 * cannot depend on which line the loop happens to reach first.

/**
 * Resolve which line carries the entry's FX metadata.
 *
 * THE RULE, in order:
 *   1. A line that already carries a non-SEK `currency` IS the FX line
 *      (hydrated draft, MCP/agent-created entry). Those lines own the
 *      metadata and nothing else is stamped. A line labelled with a DIFFERENT
 *      currency than the entry is a conflict, not something to overwrite.
 *   2. Otherwise the FX line is the monetary leg (see
 *      {@link isMonetaryLedgerAccount}) whose SEK amount equals
 *      `foreignAmount × exchangeRate`: the leg that IS the foreign amount,
 *      which is what the generators stamp. P&L and VAT legs are excluded, so a
 *      EUR supplier invoice booked 4010/2440 lands on 2440, and a EUR card
 *      purchase booked 5410/1930 lands on 1930.
 *   3. When several monetary legs match the amount (a SEK↔EUR växling books the
 *      same SEK figure on both legs), the leg on the account conventionally
 *      denominated in the entry currency wins (EUR → 1932); failing that, legs
 *      on an account conventionally denominated in ANOTHER currency (1930 =
 *      SEK) are dropped, which lands a EUR transfer on a non-default EUR
 *      account too.
 *   4. Anything still undecided is `unplaceable`. Never "first line wins":
 *      that is the order-dependence this function exists to remove.
