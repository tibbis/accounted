/**
 * Transaction-scoped actor context for journal-entry commits: isomorphic half.
 *
 * Carries WHO is relaying a commit (api_key | user | agent_chat | …) from the
 * approval entry points down to commitEntry() without threading a parameter
 * through every pending-operation executor and entry-generator in between.
 * commitEntry() reads it as a fallback and forwards it to the
 * commit_journal_entry RPC, which stamps journal_entries.committed_actor_* and
 * the audit_log COMMIT row (migration 20260619120000).
 *
 * engine.ts is reachable from client component bundles (e.g. the invoice
 * detail page), and client chunks cannot load node:async_hooks: so this
 * module holds only the type + a storage registry, and the AsyncLocalStorage
 * implementation lives in ./actor-context-node (server-only, imported by the
 * approval paths). In a client bundle the registry stays empty and getActor()
 * returns undefined: the same no-attribution default as a server call
 * outside a runWithActor() scope.
