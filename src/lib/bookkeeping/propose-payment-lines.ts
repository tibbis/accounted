 *   - Cash-method partial completion is refused server-side
 *     (cashPartialBlockReason: the generated cash entry always books the full
 *     invoice), so a remaining-based cash proposal would only book a rejected
 *     entry with a nicer preview.
 *   - A foreign-currency remaining needs a payment-day FX conversion this
 *     pure function does not carry; the dialog's FX path already handles it.
 *   - On a ROT/RUT invoice the outstanding remainder is (or includes)
 *     Skatteverket's share, which sits on 1513 and is settled by the ROT/RUT
 *     payout flow, not by clearing 1510 here. The one exception is a
 *     deduction Skatteverket refused: the reclaim voucher has already moved
 *     that share onto 1510 (deduction_reclaimed_total > 0), so the reopened
 *     remaining is an ordinary customer fordran and is proposed as such.

 *   - 0 < remaining < 1 kr (the stuck öresavrundning case): a bank-less
 *     write-off, Dr 3740 / Cr 1510, so one click closes the invoice. Polarity
 *     per buildInvoicePaymentClearingLines: the customer under-paid, so 3740
 *     takes the debit (öresavrundningsförlust).
 *   - remaining >= 1 kr: a normal clearing of the remaining, Dr bank /
