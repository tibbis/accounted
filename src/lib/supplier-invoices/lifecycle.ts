/**
 * Supplier-invoice lifecycle helpers for the 'overdue' label.
 *
 * 'overdue' is derived state (an unpaid payable past its due date) that we
 * store as a lifecycle status: the daily pg_cron job
 * update_overdue_supplier_invoices() flips 'registered'/'approved' rows there.
 * Because it is stored rather than computed, every path that can change
 * due_date, or that gates on the status, has to use the same predicate as the
 * cron. When they diverge the label sticks: before #1206 nothing ever flipped
 * back, so an unbooked invoice that aged past its due date became read-only
 * and could not even have its due date extended.
 *
 * Keep this file in sync with update_overdue_supplier_invoices()
 * (supabase/migrations/20260924204244_supplier_invoice_overdue_skip_reset_archives.sql).
 * The SQL also skips migration-reset archives, whose rows are frozen; that is
 * a company-level guard, not part of this row-level predicate.
