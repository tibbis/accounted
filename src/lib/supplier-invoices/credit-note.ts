/**
 * Where a supplier credit note rests, from the moment it is created.
 *
 * A kreditfaktura from a supplier is the reversal of an invoice we already
 * registered: Accounted creates it from the original with Kreditera, books
 * the reversing verifikat in the same request and moves the original to
 * 'credited'. Nothing is left to attest and nothing is left to pay, so the
 * row must never enter the payable lifecycle (registered, approved, overdue,
 * paid, partially_paid).
 *
 * It used to be inserted at that lifecycle's entry state, 'registered', which
 * every consumer reads as "waiting for attest": the worklist counted it as
 * "1 leverantörsfaktura att attestera" while the detail page (correctly)
 * offered no attest for a credit note, so the item could never be cleared
 * (support case 2026-09-04). 'credited' is the status the provider importers
 * already give incoming credit notes, and the CHECK constraint
 * supplier_invoices_credit_note_not_payable (20260904190000) holds every
 * writer to it.
