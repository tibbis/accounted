/**
 * The Done step's AI connection poll. The OAuth sign-in happens in another
 * tab or app, so the chip can only turn green by asking. Polling is tied to a
 * connection attempt rather than to the step being on screen: a window opens
 * on the Anslut click, the next read is scheduled only after the previous one
 * settled (a slow response can never overlap the next), and the window ends
 * when the client connects, the time runs out, a read fails, or the tab is
 * hidden. Coming back to the tab asks once and reopens the window if the
 * attempt is still unanswered: the token route may mint the key seconds
 * after the user returns.
 *
 * `fetchStatus` answers null when the status is unavailable. That never
 * reaches `onStatus`, so a failed read cannot make a connected client look
 * disconnected. An attempt waits for the named client it started, so a key
 * that names no client (see AiConnection) does not end it.
