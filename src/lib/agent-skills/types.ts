/**
 * Skills over MCP: domain-knowledge bodies the server ships alongside tools.
 *
 * Two flavors live behind the same interface:
 *
 *  - **workflow** skills are static Markdown documents the server ships
 *    alongside tools (month-end close, VAT review, year-end, invoicing,
 *    payroll). They document *how* to compose Accounted tools for a real-world
 *    workflow.
 *  - **horizontal / vertical / modifier** atoms are loaded dynamically from
 *    `agent_atom_registry`: the same atoms the in-app composer assembles for
 *    a company. Exposing them here gives Claude.ai parity with the in-app
 *    surface (plan §13 MCP parity).
 *
 * Agents call `gnubok_list_skills` to discover, then `gnubok_load_skill(slug)`
 * to read a single body. Atom slugs match their registry id verbatim
 * (e.g. "vertical/konsult-it", "modifier/holding-ab").
 *
 * Forward-compatible: when MCP adds a native `skills/list` primitive, the
 * Skill interface and bodies migrate without changes.

/**
 * Pre-conditions a skill needs to be relevant to a company. `gnubok_list_skills`
 * filters out skills whose applicability doesn't match the current company by
 * default: agents get a focused list. Pass `include_all: true` on the tool
 * call to bypass the filter when needed.
 *
 * Each condition is optional and ANDed, and evaluated only by
 * `skillAppliesToCompany` (./applicability.ts):
 *  - `entity_type: 'AB'` shows the skill only for an aktiebolag
 *  - `entity_type: 'EF'` shows it only for an enskild firma
 *  - `entity_type: 'both'` shows it for every legal form, ideell förening included
 *  - `requires: ['employees']` hides the skill until the company has ≥ 1 employee
 *  - `requires: ['vat_registered']` hides it for non-VAT-registered companies
 *
 * The tags are short codes, not the stored form (`aktiebolag`,
 * `enskild_firma`): never compare them to `entity_type` directly.
 *
 * Workflow skills that are universal (e.g. invoicing-rules) leave applicability
 * undefined and are always shown.
