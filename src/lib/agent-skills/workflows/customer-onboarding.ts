const body = `# Customer Onboarding: Accounted

Adding a customer correctly the first time avoids a long tail of wrong-VAT
invoices. This skill covers the decision tree for picking \`customer_type\`,
when to run VIES validation, and which fields are required for each path.

## When to use

- "Lägg till en ny kund / Add a customer"
- "Skapa kund: Acme AB"
- "How do I invoice an EU customer?"
- Before \`gnubok_create_invoice\` whenever the customer isn't found in \`gnubok_list_customers\`

## Decision tree: which customer_type?

The customer_type drives **the VAT treatment** on every invoice you send them.
Getting it wrong means re-issuing invoices and amending VAT declarations
later: much cheaper to ask the customer once at onboarding.

| Customer | customer_type | Required fields | VAT treatment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Swedish private person | \`individual\` | name, personal_number (optional; encrypted, masked on read) | 25/12/6 % standard, no reverse charge |
| Swedish AB / HB / KB | \`swedish_business\` | name, org_number | 25/12/6 % standard |
| Swedish enskild firma (EF) | \`individual\` | name, personal_number (an EF's org number IS the owner's personnummer; a business type refuses it) | 25/12/6 % standard |
| EU company (VAT-registered) | \`eu_business\` | name, vat_number (validated) | Reverse charge (varor + tjänster): invoice has 0 % VAT, customer pays VAT in their country |
| EU company (no VAT number) | \`eu_business\` | name, country | Treated as individual: 25 % charged, no reverse charge |
| Non-EU company | \`non_eu_business\` | name, country | Export 0 % (varor) or reverse charge per service rules |
| Non-EU private person | \`individual\` | name, country | 25 % standard for goods; export rules can apply for services |

**Special cases:**

- **B2G (Swedish municipality/agency)**: still \`swedish_business\`. Public-sector buyers require Peppol e-invoices. Accounted sends Peppol BIS Billing 3 invoices from the invoice page in the dashboard, gated per company: request access under Inställningar > Kopplingar > E-faktura via Peppol (Settings > Connections > E-invoicing via Peppol), Accounted's operators enable it, and a grant may carry a send cap that support raises. Restrictions: senders with an organisationsnummer (every legal form except enskild firma, whose org number is the owner's personnummer), standard invoices only (no credit notes), a buyer whose org number is not a personnummer (an enskild firma customer is refused until GLN identifiers are supported), SEK invoices with taxable Swedish VAT at 6, 12 or 25 % only (no reverse charge, no ROT/RUT deductions), and Er referens set. An agent checks \`gnubok_get_invoice_peppol_readiness\` and stages \`gnubok_send_invoice_peppol\` (a person approves); the user can also send from the dashboard. A successful dashboard Peppol send issues the invoice itself, so do not mark it as sent afterwards; if the dashboard reports that the invoice was sent via Peppol but could not be marked as sent, complete the issuance with \`gnubok_mark_invoice_as_sent\` on the still-draft invoice (if it already shows as sent, the verifikat exists and only its link to the invoice needs repair: do not mark it as sent again, leave the repair to support). If Peppol access is not granted, or the company is an enskild firma, deliver the invoice through an external e-invoice provider, then use \`gnubok_mark_invoice_as_sent\` to record delivery.
- **Consumer customer in another EU country (B2C distance sale)**: \`eu_business\` does NOT apply. Charge Swedish VAT (25/12/6 %) below the OSS threshold; above the threshold the company must register for OSS. This is rare for sole traders: flag the user if turnover suggests they're approaching the threshold.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check if the customer already exists

\`gnubok_list_customers\` returns all customers. Search by name client-side.
If a customer with the same org_number or vat_number exists, USE THAT ONE.
Duplicate customers fragment the AR ledger and confuse aging reports.

### Step 2: Decide customer_type

Ask the user the minimum questions needed for the decision tree above. Don't
ask "which customer_type?"; ask "is this a private person or a company?
Swedish or EU? Do they have a VAT number?". Map the answers to a
customer_type yourself.

### Step 3: Validate VAT number (EU business only)

For \`eu_business\` customers, **VIES validation is critical**. If VIES says
the VAT number is invalid (or unverifiable), reverse charge does NOT apply:
you must charge Swedish VAT instead. The wrong call here means you under-collect
VAT and Skatteverket charges interest + penalty later.

Accounted's \`gnubok_create_customer\` runs VIES automatically when \`vat_number\`
is provided. The result is stored in \`vat_number_validated\` on the customer.
Subsequent invoices read this field via \`getPermittedVatRates\` to determine
which VAT rates are legal.

If VIES is temporarily down (intermittent), Accounted marks the customer as
\`vat_number_validated = false\` and you'll see standard 25 % rates instead
of reverse charge. Re-validate by updating the customer once VIES is back.

### Step 4: Stage the customer

\`gnubok_create_customer({
  name: 'Acme GmbH',
  customer_type: 'eu_business',
  vat_number: 'DE123456789',
  email: 'invoicing@acme.de',
  country: 'Germany',
  payment_terms: 30,
})\`

Stages a pending operation for user approval. After approval, the customer
appears in \`gnubok_list_customers\` and can be invoiced via \`gnubok_create_invoice\`.

### Step 5: Sanity-check before first invoice

\`gnubok_list_customers\`: confirm the customer appears, customer_type is right.
Read \`vat_number_validated\` (for EU); if false, double-check the VAT number.

When you eventually call \`gnubok_create_invoice\`, Accounted uses the
\`getPermittedVatRates\` helper to constrain the legal rates per customer type.
The accepted set is 0/25/12/6 % for every customer type, so "VAT rate X% is not
allowed for customer type Y" means X is not a Swedish VAT rate at all: fix the
rate, and check the customer_type while you are there.

## Common errors

- *A validated \`eu_business\` invoiced at 25 %*: not refused, but almost always wrong. Reverse charge is the DEFAULT for a validated EU VAT number: leave \`vat_rate\` off (or 0) and Accounted adds the "Omvänd betalningsskyldighet" notation automatically. A Swedish rate is lawful here only for a supply taxed where it is performed (hotel/restaurang 12 %, persontransport and event admission 6 %, fastighetstjänst and korttidsuthyrning 25 %); read the \`Accounted://settings/vat-treatments\` resource before using one.
- *A \`swedish_business\` invoiced at 0 %*: also accepted (momsfritt supplies exist), but the normal domestic rate is 25/12/6 %. Do not use 0 % to avoid picking a rate.
- *"Customer not found"* on \`gnubok_create_invoice\`: the customer wasn't created (or its pending_operation wasn't approved). Run \`gnubok_list_customers\` to confirm.

## ROT/RUT-eligible customers (Swedish individuals)

ROT/RUT-avdrag applies to physical persons receiving home-services
(byggtjänster, städ, snöskottning, etc.). The customer's personnummer is
required on the invoice. Update the customer record with:

- \`fastighetsbeteckning\` (property identifier, for ROT)
- \`personal_number\` (set at creation via \`gnubok_create_customer\` or in the web form; encrypted at rest, masked on read)

Then create the invoice with ROT/RUT flag set. See the \`invoicing-rules\` skill
for the booking details (BAS accounts 1513 + 3740).

## Tools

- \`gnubok_list_customers\`: check for existing customers
- \`gnubok_create_customer\`: stage the new customer
- \`gnubok_create_invoice\`: uses the customer_type for VAT-rate validation
- (Helper, not a tool but referenced) \`getPermittedVatRates(customer_type, vat_number_validated)\`: drives the legal-rates check
