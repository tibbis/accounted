/**
 * v1 REST API wrapper.
 *
 * Every route under `app/api/v1/` is wrapped with `withApiV1('operation.name', handler)`.
 * The wrapper provides a single audit-friendly shape for the entire v1 surface:
 *
 *   1. Generates `requestId` (`req_<uuid>`) and a child logger bound to it.
 *   2. Extracts and validates the `Authorization: Bearer gnubok_sk_...` header
 *      via the existing `validateApiKey()` (atomic RPC, rate-limited).
 *   3. Resolves the required scope for the route from the v1 endpoint catalogue
 *      and returns INSUFFICIENT_SCOPE if the key lacks it. Public endpoints
 *      (`/health`, `/openapi.json`) skip the scope check but still validate
 *      the token when one is supplied.
 *   4. When the URL contains `companyId`, verifies the API key's user has
 *      access to that company via `company_members`. Multi-company keys are
 *      supported transparently: the URL is the source of truth. A key with a
 *      company allowlist (api_key_companies) is additionally refused outside
 *      it, with the same NOT_FOUND a non-member company gets. A `viewer`
 *      (read-only) membership is refused for every write: mutating method
 *      or non-`:read` scope (FORBIDDEN, details.code ROLE_READ_ONLY). So is
 *      a company the key has read-only access to (FORBIDDEN, details.code
 *      CONNECTION_READ_ONLY). A report read (GET on a `reports.*` or
 *      `arsredovisning.*` operation) refuses a dimension filter its endpoint
 *      does not register (VALIDATION_ERROR) and names any other unregistered
 *      query parameter in `X-Ignored-Query-Params` (STRICT_REPORT_QUERY_PARAMS
 *      refuses those too). A route with no `companyId` in the URL that
 *      resolves a company from a resource row (`/operations/:id`,
 *      `/webhook-deliveries/:id/retry`) runs the SAME gate through
 *      `ctx.checkCompanyAccess(companyId)` before it reads or writes anything
 *      of that company.
 *   5. Resolves the dry-run flag (`?dry_run=true` query OR `X-Dry-Run` header).
 *   6. Resolves `Idempotency-Key` (header) and replays cached responses. The
 *      dry-run flag is part of the cache identity and dry-run responses are
 *      never cached, so a simulation can never be replayed in place of the
 *      real write that follows it.
 *   7. Invokes the handler with a typed RouteContext.
 *   8. Stamps `X-Request-Id` and `Gnubok-Version` on the response, plus
 *      `Retry-After` on a 429.
 *   9. Catches any thrown value and converts it to the v1 error envelope via
 *      `v1ErrorResponse`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   export const GET = withApiV1('companies.list', async (req, ctx) => {
 *     // ctx.requestId, ctx.log, ctx.user, ctx.companyId (when in URL),
 *     // ctx.supabase, ctx.scopes, ctx.mode, ctx.dryRun, ctx.idempotencyKey
 *     return ok({ companies: [...] }, { requestId: ctx.requestId })
 *   })
