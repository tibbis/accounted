/**
 * A row amount net of VAT.
 *
 * Fortnox prices an invoice either excluding or including VAT, and says which
 * with the invoice-level `VATIncluded` flag: when it is true the row `Price`
 * and `Total` are the amounts the customer saw, VAT inside, and the net is
 * the amount divided by (1 + rate). Newer payloads also carry the net on the
 * row (`TotalExcludingVAT`, `PriceExcludingVAT`), which callers prefer when
 * present; this is the fallback for the ones that do not. Without a stated
 * rate the amount cannot be split and is returned as it is, and the
 * consumer's rows-versus-header check reports the disagreement.
 *
 * Found on Profilio (2026-09-05): 345 VAT-inclusive invoices whose rows were
 * stored as if net, so the rows summed to the gross and carried 25 % VAT on
 * top of it, beside a header that was right.

 * `InvoiceRows`. Those three live only on the detail form (`InvoiceFull`)
