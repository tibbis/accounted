/**
 * Shopify order sync: the store's paid orders and refunds as rich rows in
 * public.webshop_orders (the Orders page), replacing the earlier
 * transactions-inbox feed (which shipped but was never enabled for real
 * stores: prod holds zero Shopify feed rows, so no legacy cross-marking is
 * ever expected here).
 *
 * Row model: only PAID orders import (PAID / PARTIALLY_REFUNDED / REFUNDED;
 * a deliberate difference from the WooCommerce sync, which also imports
 * unpaid orders for the invoice flow). AUTHORIZED/PENDING orders re-surface
 * via updatedAt once payment captures. Each refund of a paid order is a
 * separate negative row parented to its order. Rows carry the booking
 * underlag the Admin API exposes without touching Shopify's protected
 * customer data program: per-rate VAT, a line-item snapshot, gateway names.
 * Customer fields stay null (deliberate v1 decision): booking works, and
 * "Skapa faktura" starts without a prefilled customer. Nothing here books
 * anything (feed-only doctrine, same as the WooCommerce and Stripe feeds).
 *
 * The write path is upsertWebshopOrders() (lib/webshop-orders/ingest), which
 * owns FX enrichment, the frozen-row rules for booked orders and the
 * cross-mark against the retired transactions feed. Overlap re-polls are
 * real upserts now (growing refund totals, status flips), not dedup no-ops.
 *
 * Rows behind company_settings.bookkeeping_locked_through import too (the
 * page is an order overview, not just a booking queue; unlike the retired
 * inbox feed, an unbookable webshop_orders row is not permanent noise). The
 * booking route and the period-lock triggers refuse to BOOK them.
 *
 * Pagination: one fixed updated_at window per run, walked with Relay cursors
 * (sortKey UPDATED_AT ascending). Cursors are stable across same-second ties,
 * so there is no offset fallback (unlike the WooCommerce sync). The persisted
 * cursor is shopify_connections.last_order_synced_at: per page the max
 * updatedAt processed, and after a fully-listed window the run's start time
 * (a scanned-through watermark, so quiet and empty-first-run stores still
 * rotate to the back of the cron's oldest-first selection). Re-polled with a
 * 24h overlap; upsert-on-(company_id, external_id) makes overlaps idempotent.
 * It never advances past failed work: a page with upsert errors caps the
 * persisted cursor just below the page's first updatedAt, so the next run
 * re-lists exactly the orders whose rows are incomplete. The connect route
 * seeds the cursor with the connection moment, so the first run starts there;
 * older history is an explicit choice (POST /backfill moves the cursor back).
