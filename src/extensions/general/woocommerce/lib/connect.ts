/**
 * WooCommerce "Auth Endpoint" handshake helpers.
 *
 * The merchant's browser is sent to {store}/wc-auth/v1/authorize; after they
 * approve, WooCommerce POSTs the generated consumer key/secret server-to-
 * server to our callback_url and redirects the browser to return_url. Our
 * oauth_state UUID rides in the handshake's user_id parameter and comes back
 * in both places, tying callback and return to the pending connection row.
 *
 * There is no signature on the callback POST, so possession of the
 * single-use state is the CSRF defense, and authenticity is proven by
 * probing the STORED store_url with the received keys before activation: a
 * forged POST would need working read credentials for the exact store the
 * user asked to connect.
 *
 * Activation itself needs TWO signals on the pending row: the verified keys
 * (callback leg, no browser session) and browser_confirmed_at (return leg,
 * bound to the initiator's session). Either leg may land first; both run
 * activateIfComplete() after writing their own signal, and the row flips to
 * active exactly once, under the DB CHECK that forbids an active row missing
 * either signal (migration 20260907143000). Every credential consumer selects
 * status = 'active', so staged keys on a pending row can never sync.
 *
 * Scope of the guarantee: a connection can never go live headless (callback
 * alone) or under a session other than the initiator's, and abandoned
 * handshakes are parked with their keys wiped. It is NOT a defense against a
 * store admin approving a link the initiator generated for them: wc-auth
 * cannot tell us who approved, and the initiator legitimately supplies the
 * second signal. The confirmation column is member-writable through RLS
 * like every other column on this row-scoped table; it records that the
 * handshake completed under a session, it is not a trust boundary.

 *   there: sessions are per domain, so a brand-domain user sent back to the
 *   canonical host would hit the initiator check with no session and land
 *   on a foreign-branded login. The server-to-server callback stays on the
 *   canonical host: no session is involved and the store must reach a
 *   stable URL.

 * The status = 'pending' scope makes it idempotent and blocks replay: an
 * active row can never be activated again.
 *
 * The TTL is part of the predicate, not only of the return leg: the
 * initiator can confirm early (the return URL is theirs to open), so
 * without it a row confirmed at minute 1 would still flip when the keys
 * land hours later. Past the TTL the flip matches zero rows and the sweep
 * parks the row; the callback still answers 200 so the store does not
 * wp_die on the merchant.
