/**
 * WooCommerce order sync: the store's orders and refunds as rich rows in
 * public.webshop_orders (the Orders page), replacing the earlier
 * transactions-inbox feed.
 *
 * Every order imports except trash and failed (including unpaid ones: the
 * Orders page shows order state and the invoice flow needs pre-payment
 * orders), carrying the
 * full booking underlag the wc/v3 payload already contains: customer billing
 * snapshot, payment method, per-rate VAT breakdown and line items. Refunds
 * are separate negative rows parented to their order. Nothing here books
 * anything: booking is a manual per-order act on the Orders page (feed-only
 * doctrine, same as before, one table over).
 *
 * The write path is upsertWebshopOrders() (lib/webshop-orders/ingest), which
 * owns FX enrichment, the frozen-row rules for booked orders and the
 * cross-mark against rows the retired transactions feed already imported.
 * Rows already imported as transactions stay bookable there; the external_id
 * scheme below is shared with that feed precisely so the overlap is a string
 * join.
 *
 * Pagination is CURSOR-based, not offset-based: each request asks for the
 * oldest orders with date_modified strictly after the current cursor
 * (orderby=modified asc, page=1), and the cursor advances to the last row of
 * each processed page. Offset pages over a fixed window would silently skip
 * rows whenever an already-fetched order is modified mid-run (it re-sorts to
 * the end and shifts every later row one index down); with a moving cursor a
 * mid-run modification simply re-surfaces the order later in the same run.
 * The one case that still needs offsets is a run of >WC_PAGE_SIZE orders
 * sharing the same date_modified second (bulk edits, migrations): those are
 * paged through with an increasing page number at a FIXED cursor, because
 * modified_after is strictly exclusive and advancing it would skip the rest
 * of the tie. Ties that span a page boundary after cursor advancement are
 * picked up by the next run's overlap re-poll.
 *
 * Cursor: woocommerce_connections.last_order_synced_at, re-polled with a 24h
 * overlap. Overlap re-polls are how status changes, late date_paid and new
 * refunds land: they are real upserts now, not dedup no-ops. The cursor
 * never advances past failed work: a page with refund-fetch failures, upsert
 * errors, or deadline-skipped refunds caps the persisted cursor just below
 * the earliest affected order's date_modified, so the next run re-lists
 * exactly the orders whose rows are incomplete. Activation seeds the cursor
 * with the connection moment, so the first run starts there; older history
 * is an explicit choice (POST /backfill moves the cursor back).
 *
 * Rows behind company_settings.bookkeeping_locked_through import too (the
 * page is an order overview, not just a booking queue); the booking route
 * and the period-lock triggers refuse to BOOK them, and the UI explains why.
