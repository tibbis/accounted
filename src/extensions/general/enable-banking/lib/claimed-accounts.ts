/**
 * Split a connection's accounts into the ones that belong in THIS company's
 * books and the ones the OAuth callback marked as already booked by another
 * of the user's companies (`claimed_by_company_id`, see lib/session-sharing).
 *
 * At one-session banks (SEB) a single BankID consent returns every account the
 * signer can see across all their companies, so a reconnect from company A
 * carries company B's accounts too. Since PR #2116 those arrive unchecked and
 * unmirrored; this helper is what keeps them out of the main list altogether,
 * so a user working in company A sees company A's accounts. The claimed set is
 * still returned (never dropped): the picker renders it behind a collapsed
 * disclosure, because an account that genuinely belongs here must stay
 * reachable (a claim is a strong hint, not proof of ownership).
 *
 * An account counts as claimed elsewhere only while it is BOTH flagged and
 * disabled here. Every writer keeps those two in step (the callback sets them
 * together, the selection save clears the flag on enable), but the invariant
 * is load-bearing: an account that syncs in this company must never be
 * tucked out of sight, so a flagged-but-enabled row (a future writer, a
 * support SQL fix) stays in the main list. The callback already lets the
 * active company's own standing state outrank a sibling claim, so a legacy
 * account enabled in both companies carries no flag and stays visible too.
