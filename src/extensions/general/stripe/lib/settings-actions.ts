/**
 * The Stripe settings panel's server calls, each classified into exactly one
 * outcome.
 *
 * Why this exists: the panel's click handlers were `try { ... } finally {
 * setSyncing(false) }` with no `catch`. A fetch that rejected (offline, DNS,
 * connection reset, a serverless instance that never answers) skipped every
 * toast line and landed in `finally`, so the spinner started, stopped, and the
 * user was told nothing at all: not that it failed, not to retry, not to check
 * the connection.
 *
 * The classification lives here rather than inside the component because this
 * repo has no component tests (vitest runs in `node`, scoped to `lib/` and
 * `app/api/`): logic left in the panel is logic nothing can check.
 *
 * The failure union is `@/lib/browser/action-failure`'s, so the panel maps a
 * failure through the same `failureDescription` as the salary payment panels and
 * the three reasons mean the same thing everywhere in the app.
 *
 * Exactly one toast per click: TOAST_LIMIT is 1 (components/ui/use-toast.tsx),
 * so a second toast emitted in the same tick evicts the first and only the last
 * one is ever rendered. Every outcome below therefore resolves to one sentence.
