/**
 * Auth resolution for READ paths (skattekonto sync, kvittens polling, moms
 * inlamnat/beslutat checks, the skattekonto page's connected check).
 *
 * Preference order:
 *   1. System credentials, when SKATTEVERKET_SYSTEM_AUTH_MODE=on, the system
 *      flow is configured, and the company's connection row shows the
 *      required behorighet as granted for the current environment.
 *   2. A user token connected to the company. Token rows are per
 *      (user_id, company_id), so a company can hold one row per member who
 *      ran the BankID consent. The caller's own row is preferred when it
 *      exists; otherwise the most recently issued active row for the company
 *      is used. That is what lets member B read data member A connected
 *      (issue #1673): the fetched skattekonto/declaration data belongs to
 *      the company, not to the person who happened to press "Anslut".
 *
 * Who may read: any member of the company. Membership is enforced upstream
 * (the extension dispatcher resolves ctx.companyId from the caller's own
 * memberships, and the token table's SELECT policy is company-scoped), so no
 * extra role check is added here. Reads never move the row: refresh writes
 * go back to the token owner's row (auth.userId is the owner, not the
 * caller).
 *
 * Write paths (moms utkast/las, AGI submit/spara/granskningsunderlag) stay
 * hard-wired to user mode with the CALLER's own token: the personal flow
 * needs no ombud grant and the BankID signing step is personal by nature.
 * Connect/disconnect likewise only touch the caller's own row.
 *
 * Retiring user-token reads later (the full ombud switch) is a policy change
 * inside this function only.
