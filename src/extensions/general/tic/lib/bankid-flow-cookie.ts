/**
 * Server-held state for an in-flight BankID flow.
 *
 * Why the session id is not allowed near the browser's JavaScript
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 * A TIC `sessionId` is an unauthenticated bearer credential. Anyone holding
 * one can POST it to /bankid/poll (skipAuth) and read the holder's
 * personnummer, or POST it to /bankid/complete with mode 'login' and receive a
 * `tokenHash` that `verifyOtp` turns into a full Supabase session, with MFA
 * skipped because BankID accounts carry `bankid_linked`. It used to be handed
 * to the client and kept in `sessionStorage`, which made every one of those a
 * single XSS away, and made the obvious fix for the cross-tab bug (move it to
 * `localStorage` so the tab BankID returns to can resume) a straight upgrade
 * of any same-origin XSS into a login-fixation primitive.
 *
 * So the id never leaves the server. It lives in an HttpOnly cookie that the
 * browser attaches to the BankID endpoints and nothing else:
 *
 *   • HttpOnly     script cannot read it, so XSS cannot steal a session.
 *   • signed       script cannot FORGE one. It does not stop a script from
 *                  planting a cookie the server genuinely minted (an attacker
 *                  can fetch one with curl), and it does not bind the flow to
 *                  a browser or a person. Planting a completed identification
 *                  is what login fixation is, so the protection against that
 *                  is not here: it is the client refusing to consume a flow
 *                  this browsing context did not start without an explicit
 *                  confirmation. See BankIdAuth's resume handling.
 *   • __Host-      forbids Domain and forces Path=/, which leaves exactly one
 *                  possible (name, domain, path) for this cookie. Without it a
 *                  script can plant the same name at a LONGER path, which the
 *                  browser sends first and the server's deletion cannot reach.
 *   • SameSite=Lax the BankID app returns the user by top-level navigation
 *                  from outside the site; Strict would drop the cookie there
 *                  and strand exactly the flow this exists to serve.
 *   • short Max-Age a BankID order is good for ~3 minutes. An abandoned flow
 *                  should not outlive it by much.
 *
 * Being a cookie rather than client storage is also what fixes the original
 * bug: cookies are shared by every tab of the origin, so whichever tab BankID
 * returns the user to, new or reloaded, simply polls and continues. No
 * client-side handoff, no cross-tab lock, no heartbeat.
 *
 * `mode` is pinned here at /start and read back at /complete, so the flow a
 * session was opened for is the only flow that can finish it. The client
 * cannot ask to complete a 'link' session as a 'login'.

 * the exact (name, domain, path) triple, so without the prefix a script could
 * set the SAME NAME at a longer path; RFC 6265 §5.4 serialises longer paths
 * first, so the planted one would win, and a Max-Age=0 written to the shorter
 * path could never delete it. `__Host-` forbids `Domain` and forces `Path=/`,
 * which leaves exactly one possible (name, domain, path) for this cookie: the
 * one the server owns. That also blocks cookie-tossing from a sibling
 * white-label subdomain.
 *
 * Losing the narrow Path is the price. It is worth it: the narrow Path only
