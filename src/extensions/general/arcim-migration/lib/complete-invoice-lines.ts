/**
 * Finish a migrated sales-invoice register: fetch the rows (and the VAT split)
 * for the invoices that were imported without them.
 *
 * The migration maps invoices from the provider's LIST payload and hydrates
 * the detail form inside a fixed budget (see lib/providers/provider-data-
 * fetcher.ts). Fortnox, Briox and Björn Lundén ship no rows in a list
 * response, so every invoice the budget did not reach lands as a header with
 * a total and no invoice_items behind it: Profilio (384 of 384, migrated
 * before hydration existed), Loftux (311 of 672), Damac (182 of 542),
 * Clearstoq (1 125 of 1 125). Nothing ever came back for them, and the wizard
 * had not said so.
 *
 * This pass is the follow-up. It is re-runnable and makes progress on every
 * run: it starts from OUR side (the non-draft invoices in this company that
 * have no rows), joins them to the provider's register on invoice number AND
 * date (unique on both sides, the same strictness as the registration-voucher
 * relink), hydrates only those, and writes each invoice's rows once the
 * provider's detail total agrees with the stored total to the öre. A run that
 * runs out of budget leaves the rest for the next one; nothing is guessed and
 * nothing is inserted for an invoice the provider does not know.
 *
 * What it writes, and only this:
 *   - invoice_items for an invoice that has none;
 *   - the header VAT split (subtotal, vat_amount, vat_rate, vat_treatment and
 *     their SEK twins) when the stored split is the "unknown" shape the old
 *     import left behind (no rate, or 0 kr VAT beside subtotal = total).
 * Never the total, the status, the customer, payments or any journal entry:
 * momsdeklaration and every report read the ledger, not these columns, so
 * filling them changes what the invoice page shows and nothing that was
 * filed (see the 2026-08-22 verification in DECISIONS.md).
 *
 * Both are written by one call to the complete_invoice_rows RPC per invoice
 * (migration 20260906135730), the write path the migration wizard shares: it
 * locks the invoice, inserts the rows only when the invoice still has none
 * and applies the header split in the same transaction, so an invoice's rows
 * are written at most once whichever writer gets there first, and "rows
 * landed, header did not" is not a reachable state. The call goes through
 * completeInvoiceRows (lib/invoices/complete-invoice-rows.ts), which also
 * writes the behandlingshistorik event for every invoice the RPC filled: one
 * InvoiceRowsCompleted per invoice, with the header split before and after
 * (BFL 5 kap 11 §, BFNAR 2013:2 p. 9.16). Every invoice a run completes
 * shares one correlation id, so a run is one thread in the trail.
