/**
 * Skeleton kontering for a matched transaction the engine has no proposal for.
 *
 * When suggest-booking comes back empty (unknown supplier, withheld
 * foreign-currency rule, engine failure) the manual-booking dialog used to
 * open with nothing at all, even though the matched bank row already tells us
 * the amount in kronor and the settlement account. This rebuilds what
 * BookDirectlyDialog's buildPrefillLines seeded before the dialog swap:
 * the transaction's SEK amount against the settlement account, with the
 * counter-account left blank for the user to pick. No VAT split: the
 * skeleton is built from the bank row alone, and the document total and the
 * bank movement are not guaranteed to agree. BookDirectlyDialog no longer
 * matches this: with a selected SEK transaction it keeps the document's
 * extracted VAT, except for a company that is not VAT-registered
 * (lib/bookkeeping/book-direct-prefill.ts).
 *
 * The SEK amount goes through resolveSekAmountOrNull: a foreign row with
 * neither a stored SEK value nor a rate has no honest kronor figure, and
 * prefilling the raw foreign number would relabel 100 EUR as 100 kr. In that
 * case we return no lines and the dialog opens blank, as it does today.
