/**
 * Crash recovery for the staged upload.
 *
 * The web upload route inserts the inbox row as 'processing' and defers
 * Bedrock extraction to an after() worker that can die with the serverless
 * instance. A row stuck in 'processing' is durable state with no live owner:
 * this sweep flips it to 'received' with the empty extraction skeleton so it
 * becomes a normal manually-editable item. Deliberately NO re-extraction
 * here: the UI retry button covers that, and a cron that silently re-spends
 * Bedrock tokens on every crash would hide the crashes.
 *
 * Overlap with a slow live worker is safe: every mutation is a guarded claim
 * on status='processing' (and extracted_data still NULL), so the sweep and
 * the worker never both win one row.

 * worker can therefore be legitimately silent for several minutes; a cutoff
 * shorter than its worst case makes the sweep steal the row and discard the
 * worker's real result via the status CAS. Ten minutes clears the two-call
 * worst case with margin while still flipping genuinely crashed rows well
