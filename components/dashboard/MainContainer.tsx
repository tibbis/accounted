 * Picks the dashboard chrome container based on route. Extension workspaces

 * multi-pane layouts; everything else gets the padded full-bleed canvas.
 *
 * Lives in a client component because the parent (dashboard) layout is
 * shared across all dashboard routes. Server-side pathname checks done in
 * the layout don't re-evaluate reliably on soft navigation between sibling
 * routes, so the wrapper class would otherwise stick on whichever branch
 * the first render picked.
