## ${API_V1_VERSION} *(current)*

The first stable release of the public REST API. Six phases of development covering the full agent-native surface: authentication + discovery, invoicing vertical, transactions vertical, bookkeeping engine + suppliers + compliance check, payroll + reports + import, webhooks.

### Authentication + discovery (Phase 1)

- API key auth via \`Authorization: Bearer gnubok_sk_<random>\` (live keys) / \`gnubok_sk_test_<random>\` (test keys). 100 RPM rate limit per key.
- \`gnubok_sk_test_*\` keys: same company as a live key, every write forced into dry-run (\`X-Gnubok-Mode: test\`). There is no separate sandbox company or host.
- Scope-based authorisation per endpoint (\`invoices:read\`, \`payroll:write\`, \`webhooks:manage\`, ...).
- Discovery: \`GET /llms.txt\`, \`GET /api/v1/openapi.json\`, \`GET /.well-known/skills/index.json\`.
- Health: \`GET /api/v1/health\`.
- Response envelope: \`{ data, meta: { request_id, api_version, audit, next_cursor } }\`.
- \`X-Request-Id\` on every response; idempotency on every write.

### Invoices vertical (Phase 2)

- **Customers**: GET list + detail, POST create + bulk-create, PATCH, DELETE.
- **Invoices**: GET list + detail, POST create, PATCH, lifecycle verbs \`/mark-sent\`, \`/mark-paid\`, \`/credit\`, \`/send\`, \`/bulk-create\`. PDF download at \`/{id}/pdf\`.
- VIES validation runs on commit for EU-business customers with a VAT number.
- Mixed-rate invoices supported: per-item \`vat_rate\` overrides the header rate.
- ROT/RUT-avdrag flow and supplier-invoice fakturamodellen on the AP side.

### Transactions vertical (Phase 3)

- **Transactions**: cursor-paginated GET list + detail. Single-tx verbs \`/categorize\`, \`/uncategorize\`, \`/match-invoice\`, \`/match-supplier-invoice\`. Bulk \`/ingest\` (up to 500), \`/batch-categorize\` (up to 100).
- **Reconciliation**: \`POST /reconciliation/bank/run\`, \`GET /reconciliation/bank/status\`.
- **Reads**: \`GET /accounts\`, \`GET /fiscal-periods\`.
- All write surfaces honour strict-mode (commit fully or error with no side effects).

### Chart of accounts (2026-09)

- **Order** (2026-09-11): \`GET /accounts\` returns accounts in \`account_number\` order, the BAS sequence it always documented. It used to sort by the stored \`sort_order\`, which is \`0\` on every account seeded at company creation, so the seeded accounts came first and the rest followed.
- **Class filter**: \`?class\` accepts any digit \`0\`-\`9\`, the first digit of \`account_number\`. Class \`9\` appears on internal accounts carried over from an imported chart and could not be filtered on before.
- **Schema**: the response schema lists the \`account_type\` values (\`untaxed_reserves\` included), \`normal_balance\` and \`default_vat_treatment\`. No field was added or removed, and the API version date is unchanged.
- **Journal entry dry runs**: \`POST /journal-entries?dry_run=true\` now resolves the lines' accounts against the chart and fails with \`400 ACCOUNTS_NOT_IN_CHART\` for a deactivated account or a non-BAS number the chart does not contain, the same verdict as the live call. A standard BAS account that is not in the chart yet still passes: the live call adds it.

### OpenAPI spec and reference pages (2026-09)

- **Query parameters in the spec**: \`/api/v1/openapi.json\` now lists every endpoint's query parameters (filters, pagination \`cursor\` / \`limit\`, report \`period_id\` and date ranges, \`expand\`) with type, requiredness and description, and \`dry_run\` on every dry-run-capable endpoint. Before, the spec carried path parameters only.
- **Nullable fields**: nullable fields are published as \`type: [T, "null"]\` (OpenAPI 3.1). Before, they read as non-null, so a strict generated client could reject a valid response.
- **Reference pages**: each endpoint section shows its query parameters, request body fields and response fields. New pages: Bank accounts (\`/cash-accounts\`, \`/bank-connections\`), Skatteverket (filed VAT declarations) and Health; company settings are on Companies, vacation-year close on Salary runs.
- Documentation only: no request or response changed, and the API version date is unchanged.

### Reconciliation, account-keyed (2026-08)

- **Accounts**: \`GET /reconciliation/accounts\` lists every account with an outside truth (bank accounts as \`bank:<cash_account_id>\`, the skattekonto as \`skattekonto\`) with status; \`GET .../accounts/{accountKey}\` is the bridge (outside balance, ledger, difference, unexplained, explanatory lines, counts, latest sign-off); \`GET .../accounts/{accountKey}/items\` the rows behind it, bucketed (proposed, unmatched_external, unmatched_ledger, matched, ignored, upcoming).
- **Links**: \`POST .../accounts/{accountKey}/links\` (pairs or \`use_proposals\`), \`DELETE .../links/{linkId}\`, \`POST .../items/{itemId}/ignore\`. Links never touch the ledger.
- **Sign-off**: \`POST .../accounts/{accountKey}/signoff\` ("avstämt t.o.m." a date; refused with an unexplained difference unless forced with a note), \`GET .../signoff\` history, \`POST .../signoff/{signoffId}/reopen\`.
- New scopes \`reconciliation:read\`, \`reconciliation:write\`, \`reconciliation:signoff\`. The legacy \`/reconciliation/bank/*\` endpoints and their \`transactions:*\` scopes are unchanged.
- **Webhooks**: new event types \`reconciliation.matched\`, \`reconciliation.unmatched\`, \`reconciliation.signed_off\`, \`reconciliation.reopened\`. Additive: existing subscriptions are unaffected and the API version date is unchanged.

### Reports, companies, Skatteverket, customers, transactions (2026-08, additive)

Backfilled 2026-08-26 from merged PRs. Every item is additive (new endpoints, optional fields, optional filters): the API version date stays \`${API_V1_VERSION}\`.

- **Custom date ranges on reports** (#1909, 2026-08-25): \`GET /reports/income-statement\` accepts optional \`from_date\` / \`to_date\` (\`YYYY-MM-DD\`, both inside the fiscal period named by \`period_id\`, \`from_date <= to_date\`). \`GET /reports/balance-sheet\` is a position, so it takes only \`to_date\` (or its alias \`as_of\`) and refuses \`from_date\`. Omit them for the whole period, as before. These routes now reject unknown query parameters with \`400 VALIDATION_ERROR\` (\`unknown_params\` + \`allowed_params\` in details) instead of silently returning a full-period report.
- **Report PDFs** (#1909): \`GET /reports/balance-sheet/pdf\` and \`GET /reports/income-statement/pdf\` return \`application/pdf\`, byte-equivalent to the dashboard export, with the same \`period_id\` and range parameters. Scope \`reports:read\`.
- **Company creation** (#1864, 2026-08-25): \`POST /api/v1/companies\` (scope \`companies:write\`) creates a company and sets it up in one call: owner membership, BAS chart of accounts for the company form, compliance settings, the first fiscal period and the automatic tax deadlines. A VAT-registered company must send \`moms_period\`. Not idempotent, and \`Idempotency-Key\` is not honoured on this company-less route: list \`GET /api/v1/companies\` before retrying.
- **Filed VAT declarations** (#1773, 2026-08-21): \`GET /skatteverket/vat-declarations?period_type=&year=&period=\` (scope \`compliance:read\`) reads one period's momsdeklaration as Skatteverket has it on file: \`submitted\` (SKV inlämnat) and \`decided\` (SKV beslutat), each \`null\` when nothing is on file. Live read, requires an active Skatteverket connection on the company.
- **Company settings write** (#1405, 2026-08-04): \`PATCH /companies/{companyId}/settings\` (scope \`companies:write\`, risk medium, dry-run supported) updates bank details (\`bank_name\`, \`clearing_number\`, \`account_number\`, \`bankgiro\`, \`plusgiro\`, \`swish\`, \`iban\`, \`bic\`), \`contact_person\`, \`email\`, \`phone\`, \`website\` and \`invoice_email_texts\`, with the same validation as the MCP tool.
- **Customer \`personal_number\`** (#1724 2026-08-20, #1788 2026-08-21): \`personal_number\` on customer create, bulk-create, detail, PATCH and list. Accepted only for \`customer_type=individual\`, stored encrypted, always returned masked (\`********-1234\`); sending the masked form on PATCH means "leave unchanged", \`null\` clears it. A personnummer-shaped \`org_number\` on a business customer type is refused (\`400 CUSTOMER_ORG_NUMBER_IS_PERSONAL\`); on an individual it is moved into \`personal_number\` and \`org_number\` is cleared, or refused with \`400 CUSTOMER_PERSONAL_NUMBER_CONFLICT\` when it differs from a \`personal_number\` in the same body.
- **Ignore a transaction** (#1661, 2026-08-29): \`POST /transactions/{id}/ignore\` (scope \`transactions:write\`, risk low, idempotent, dry-run supported) marks an unbooked bank transaction as ignored without writing a verifikat, so it is allowed in a locked or closed period: the path for rows that are not business events (PSD2 ghost rows, duplicates, transfers that never executed). \`DELETE\` on the same path restores the row. A booked transaction (directly, via a payment allocation, or via a voucher link) is refused with \`409 TX_IGNORE_ALREADY_BOOKED\`. In the same change, \`/categorize\` and \`/batch-categorize\` answer \`is_business: false\` in a locked period with \`400 TX_CATEGORIZE_PRIVATE_PERIOD_LOCKED\` (\`details.suggested_action: "ignore"\`) instead of a bare \`PERIOD_LOCKED\`: a private marking is a real eget uttag / insättning booking, so the lock still applies to it.
- **Transactions by bank account** (#1809, 2026-08-23): transaction list and detail carry \`cash_account_id\`; \`GET /transactions?cash_account_id=<uuid>\` filters to one bank account.

### Bookkeeping primitives + AP + compliance (Phase 4)

- **Suppliers + supplier-invoices** vertical (mirror of Phase 2 invoices on the AP side).
- **Journal entries** primitives: \`POST /journal-entries\` (draft+commit), \`/{id}/commit\`, \`/{id}/reverse\` (storno) and \`/{id}/correct\` (rättelse): both satisfy BFL 5 kap 5 § (storno is the canonical method of rättelse), \`/batch-create\`.
- **Voucher gap explanations**: \`POST /voucher-gap-explanations\` per BFNAR 2013:2.
- **Fiscal-periods ops**: \`/lock\`, \`/close\` and \`/opening-balances\` are synchronous and return 200 with the updated period; \`/year-end\` and \`/currency-revaluation\` are async and return 202 with operation_id (poll at \`GET /api/v1/operations/{id}\`).
- **Compliance check**: \`GET /compliance/check?type={year_end_readiness|voucher_gaps}\`: pre-flight findings before submission.
- **Documents**: \`POST /documents\` (multipart upload, magic-number-checked), \`GET /{id}/download\` (15-min signed URL), \`POST /{id}/link\` (attach to journal entry).

### Payroll + reports + import (Phase 5)

- **Employees**: full CRUD with personnummer masking on list/create per GDPR Art.5(1)(c). Soft-delete via \`is_active\`.
- **Salary runs**: CRUD + lifecycle verbs \`/calculate\`, \`/approve\`, \`/mark-paid\`, \`/book\`, \`/generate-agi\`. State machine: draft → review → approved → paid → booked. \`/generate-agi\` produces and persists the arbetsgivardeklaration XML: the response carries it as \`data.xml\` for the integrator to upload to Skatteverket Mina Sidor (or via the optional \`skatteverket\` extension). Accounted does NOT auto-submit; the AGI deadline: **the 12th of the following month for every reporting period EXCEPT January and August, where companies with annual turnover ≤ 40 MSEK get the 17th**: is the integrator's responsibility.
- **JSON reports** (13): trial-balance, balance-sheet, income-statement, general-ledger, journal-register, vat-declaration, monthly-breakdown, ar-ledger, supplier-ledger, continuity-check, salary-journal, avgifter-basis, vacation-liability.
- **Binary report**: \`GET /reports/sie-export\` (text/plain SIE4 file). Note: a SIE4 export alone does NOT satisfy BFL 7 kap archiving obligations: SIE captures account-level positions and verifikationer but lacks system documentation and behandlingshistorik. Treat SIE as a portability format (Fortnox/Visma/Bokio migration), not as a complete archive.
- **Async imports**: \`POST /imports/sie\` (multipart, 50 MB), \`POST /imports/bank\` (multipart, 10 MB, auto-format detection across 12 bank formats). Both async via \`operations\` substrate. **Post-SIE-import warning:** SIE files do NOT carry VAT codes or tax-rate-to-account mappings, AND they do NOT transfer behandlingshistorik (the source system's processing log required by BFNAR 2013:2 kap 8 §) or systemdokumentation. After importing from Fortnox / Visma / BL / SpeedLedger / Bokio you MUST manually reconfigure VAT codes (typically via \`/settings/tax-codes\`) before the first momsdeklaration; skipping this step is the most common source of incorrect VAT submissions in migrated bookkeeping. The behandlingshistorik gap must be preserved separately: under BFNAR 2013:2 kap 8 § the obligation attaches to the entire räkenskapsår, not from the import date forward. Best practice for a mid-year migration: export the source system's behandlingshistorik for the full fiscal year and archive it alongside the SIE file. Accounted starts a fresh behandlingshistorik from the import date forward; the pre-import portion of the year remains the source system's record.

### 2026-05-15: Webhooks (Phase 6 PR-1)

- **Subscriptions**: \`POST /webhooks\` (HMAC secret returned exactly once), GET list + detail, PATCH, DELETE. Per-event-type elevated scope check (\`salary_run.*\` and \`agi.generated\` require \`payroll:read\`).
- **Delivery substrate**: dispatched immediately after the event is enqueued, with a per-minute Vercel cron at \`/api/webhooks/dispatch/cron\` as the retry and sweep path. Due rows are claimed atomically via the \`claim_due_webhook_deliveries\` SQL function (\`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED\`), with \`*.pg.test.ts\` coverage for the claim path and the webhook DB triggers. Exponential backoff \`1m / 5m / 30m / 2h / 12h / 24h / 48h\` (7 retries, ~87h total). HTTP 410 from receiver auto-disables the webhook.
- **Signature**: \`X-Gnubok-Signature: t=<unix>,v1=<hex-HMAC-SHA256>\`. Stripe-format. Sample receivers in [Node + Python](/docs/api/webhooks#verifying-signatures).
- **SSRF protection**: webhook_url must be HTTPS; resolved IPs in private/loopback/link-local/CGNAT/cloud-metadata ranges are rejected at create AND dispatch time. Dispatch pins the validated IP through a DNS-rebinding-safe \`node:https.request\` agent (\`lib/webhooks/pinned-fetch.ts\`); redirects are refused on every outbound POST (any 3xx is treated as a blocked redirect).
- **Audit + retention**: webhook delivery rows are *behandlingshistorik* per BFNAR 2013:2 kap 8 §: immutable once terminal so the audit trail of what an integration was notified of stays intact. Delivery rows are NOT räkenskapsinformation themselves; the 7-year statutory retention under BFL 7 kap 1 § applies only to the underlying verifikation / faktura / AGI XML in its own table, NOT to the delivery envelope. Accounted keeps accounting-event delivery rows for 7 years as a voluntary operational policy (the duration aligns with BFL 7 kap on the underlying records but is not itself a statutory obligation on delivery rows). Webhook DELETE preserves the delivery audit trail (\`ON DELETE SET NULL\` on \`webhook_id\`). Webhook lifecycle events (create / update / delete, plus dispatcher auto-disable) each write a V16 \`audit_log\` entry.
- **Verbs**: \`POST /webhooks/{id}/test\` enqueues a synthetic event; \`POST /webhook-deliveries/{id}/retry\` re-enqueues a dead/delivered delivery.

### Coming soon (Phase 6 PR-2 hardening)

- 90-day TTL cleanup cron for non-accounting webhook deliveries
- Per-route rate limits on \`:test\`, \`:retry\`, and webhook \`:create\`
- Populated \`previous_attributes\` for update-style webhook events
