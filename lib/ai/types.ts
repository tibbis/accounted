// lib/ai/provider.ts; the OpenAI-compatible service talks to any endpoint
// that implements the chat-completions API (the Swedish inference providers a
// sovereign self-host points at) through the Vercel AI SDK.
//
// Streaming members (the chat loop) are deliberately absent until the chat
// runtime decision is taken: see the Sovereign plan, alignment rule R3.
