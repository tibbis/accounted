/**
 * Who paid for an underlag: the one question that decides how it is booked.

 * 'company' -> the bank line is matched (or the supplier invoice is
 * registered and marked paid against a picked transaction); 'unpaid' -> a
 * supplier invoice on 2440 with a due date; 'owner' / 'employee' -> an
 * utlägg: cost + moms are booked at once against that person's liability
 * account and an expense_claims row keeps the debt open until it is repaid.

 * Shared by the Underlag pane, the supplier-invoice form and the
 * supplier-invoice route so the answer has one vocabulary and one account
