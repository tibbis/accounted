/**
 * Invoice Matching: auto-match income transactions to unpaid customer invoices.
 *
 * Amounts are only ever compared inside one currency: same currency → raw
 * magnitudes, different currencies → the invoice's STORED SEK conversion
 * against a SEK bank row. An invoice with no usable SEK value is not offered
 * at all, because comparing a raw EUR total against a kronor bank row is what
 * makes a 1 000 EUR invoice "exactly match" a 1 000 kr receipt. OCR/reference
 * matching is deliberately exempt: the reference identifies the invoice on its
 * own and no amount is involved.
 *
 * That guard is silent by design, which is its own problem: the user never
 * learns why the EUR invoice that obviously matches is missing from the
 * suggestions. `findInvoiceMatchCandidates()` therefore returns the dropped
 * invoices alongside the matches (same shape as `unconverted_fx_count` in
 * lib/reports/supplier-ledger.ts), so a caller can name them and point at the
 * repair: POST /api/invoices/{id}/refresh-exchange-rate.
 *
 * Which references identify an invoice is NOT decided here: lib/invoices/ocr-keys.ts
 * owns that, and derives them from the same generator the PDF prints, so the
 * value the customer types into the bank (invoice number digits + Luhn check
 * digit) is always one of the values this matcher looks for.
 *
 * The supplier-side twin is lib/invoices/supplier-invoice-matching.ts. Keep the
 * two guards in step.
