 * Visma invoice recorded its gross as its net and 0 kr of VAT. The row reader
 * asked for `LineTotal` and `VatRatePercent`, neither of which exists in the
 * schema, so every line landed with a 0 amount and the hardcoded 25 % default.
 *
 * `TotalAmount` and `TotalVatAmount` are both in the company's accounting
 * currency, while `currencyCode` below reports the INVOICE currency; the
 * `*InvoiceCurrency` twins carry the invoice-currency figures. What matters
 * for VAT is reading a consistent pair, so both come from the
 * accounting-currency family here. The currency-label mismatch on foreign
 * invoices predates this change and is deliberately left alone:
 * `RemainingAmount` and the paid/balance logic read that same family, and
 * switching only the totals would desync payment status.
