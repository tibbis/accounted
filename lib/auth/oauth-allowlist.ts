/**
 * Built-in redirect URI patterns. These bypass the DB lookup entirely so
 * the Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini and Cursor connectors keep working without seeded rows, and so
 * local development never depends on having a registration.
 *
 * ChatGPT uses a per-connector-instance callback path
 * (https://chatgpt.com/connector/oauth/{callback_id}) plus the legacy fixed
 * callback for already-published apps; both are documented at
 * developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/build/auth.
 *
 * Grok (grok.com custom connectors) registers itself through /register as a
 * public client and sends a single fixed callback,
 * https://grok.com/connectors-oauth-exchange-code/, published by X Corp as
 * the "Grok (web)" redirect URL at docs.x.com/x-ads-api/mcp (xAI's own
 * connector docs at docs.x.ai do not state it). grok.com serves the path
 * itself: the slash form 308s to the no-slash form on the same origin, so
 * both are accepted. Matched as an exact path, never a prefix, so a future
 * grok.com path cannot ride on this entry.
 *
 * Gemini Enterprise custom MCP (Google Cloud) sends a single documented
 * callback, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/oauth-redirect
 * (docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/enterprise/docs/connectors/custom-mcp-server).
 * Matched as an exact path. Gemini CLI uses the localhost rule. The consumer
 * gemini.google.com app has no published custom-connector callback yet.
 *
 * Cursor (IDE and CLI) registers through /register with three redirect URIs
 * in one request: the legacy custom-scheme deeplink
 * cursor://anysphere.cursor-mcp/oauth/callback, the web fallback used by
 * Cloud Agents and Automations https://www.cursor.com/agents/mcp/oauth/callback,
 * and the RFC 8252 loopback http://localhost:8787/callback that current
 * builds actually redirect to (Cursor staff statement, forum.cursor.com
 * thread 165019). /register rejects the whole set when any one URI is
 * unknown, so the two non-loopback callbacks are allowlisted here as exact
 * matches; the loopback already passes through the local rule. The custom
 * scheme is accepted despite RFC 8252 section 8.4 (any local app can claim a
 * scheme) because the code is PKCE-bound to the client that started the flow
 * (S256 only, verifier required at /token, a code minted without a challenge
 * can never be exchanged) and the loopback form carries the same
 * local-machine trust. It is its own provider, `cursor_deeplink`, so the
 * consent page can show it unverified like localhost: a scheme proves
 * nothing about who receives the code, an https host does.
