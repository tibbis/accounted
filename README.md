## Why Accounted?

**Compliant by construction.** Accounted implements double-entry bookkeeping under Swedish accounting law (Bokföringslagen). Voucher immutability, sequential voucher numbering, period locks, and 7-year document retention are enforced by database triggers, not by convention. Corrections are made the legal way, with reversal entries (storno), never by editing history. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for how.

**Agent-native.** The full bookkeeping engine is exposed as 150+ MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools with scoped API keys or OAuth, so an AI agent can do the books in Accounted: categorize transactions, draft vouchers, reconcile periods, and prepare declarations. Posting is staged for human approval, so the agent proposes and you decide.

**Yours to run.** AGPL-3.0 licensed and fully self-hostable with Docker and Supabase. Use the hosted version at [app.accounted.se](https://app.accounted.se) or run your own.

## Features

## Self-Hosting

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erp-mafia/accounted.git
cd accounted
./setup.sh              # Prompts for Supabase credentials, generates .env
docker compose up -d
```

You need a Supabase project and must apply the database migrations before first use. See [docs/SELF-HOSTING.md](docs/SELF-HOSTING.md) for the full step-by-step guide, including Supabase setup, auth configuration, optional features (AI, email, push notifications), and troubleshooting. To run everything on Swedish infrastructure (your own Supabase stack, Swedish hosting, AI on Swedish GPUs), see [docs/SOVEREIGN.md](docs/SOVEREIGN.md).

## Development Setup

Prerequisites: Node.js 20 or newer (CI runs Node 20; the Docker image ships Node 22), a Supabase project.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # Start dev server (auto-generates extension registry)
npm test          # Run tests
npm run build     # Production build
npm run lint      # ESLint
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full development workflow.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript (strict)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Row Level Security + email/password auth + TOTP MFA)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui
- **Integrations**: Enable Banking (PSD2), Qvalia (Peppol), Skatteverket, Anthropic SDK on Amazon Bedrock (eu-north-1; direct Anthropic or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint for self-hosted via the Vercel AI SDK), Resend, JSZip
