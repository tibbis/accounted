/**
 * Re-run the registration-voucher link for a company that was migrated
 * before the migration wrote it (or whose GL landed via SIE after the
 * invoices did).
 *
 * The imported invoice rows do not store the provider's voucher ref, so the
 * only way to recover it is to ask the provider again: the registers are
 * re-fetched (hydrated, so Fortnox detail payloads carry VoucherSeries /
 * VoucherNumber), joined to the invoices that are still unlinked, and handed
 * to the core linker, which decides and writes with the same guarantees the
 * migration itself uses. Nothing is inserted: an invoice the provider knows
 * but this company does not is skipped, not imported.
 *
 * Join keys are deliberately strict: invoice number AND invoice date, on
 * both registers, and only when that pair is unique on both sides. The
 * unlinked rows are read from the whole company, so a native (non-migrated)
 * invoice that is unbooked for its own reasons (a kontantmetod invoice, a
 * draft) sits next to the migrated ones; requiring the date as well as the
 * number, and excluding sales drafts (a migrated row is a draft only when the
 * source had no voucher for it anyway; supplier_invoices has no draft status),
 * keeps a native invoice that happens to reuse a provider number from being
 * handed to the linker. Two suppliers can legitimately issue "1001" in the
 * same year, and a wrong join would hand the linker a plausible but wrong
 * candidate.
