# CLAUDE.md: Accounted

Swedish accounting SaaS: double-entry bookkeeping under Swedish accounting law (Bokföringslagen) for sole traders (enskild firma) and limited companies (aktiebolag). Multi-tenant: users belong to companies via `company_members`; `teams` group companies for consultants.

**Stack**: Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript 5 strict, Zod 4, Supabase (Postgres + RLS + auth), Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui. Vercel-hosted is the primary target; Docker self-hosted must keep working but never at hosted's expense. Path alias `@/*` = repo root. All code, comments, and commits in English.

## Hard Rules

The accounting rules are Swedish law, enforced by DB triggers. Code that violates them fails at runtime; code that works around the triggers breaks legal compliance. Never do either.

1. **Never edit or delete a posted journal entry outside the two sanctioned rättelse paths.** BFL 5 kap 5 § allows two correction tracks: (a) storno: cancel with `reverseEntry()`, correct with `correctEntry()` (`lib/core/bookkeeping/storno-service.ts`); (b) inline rättelse (founder-approved 2026-07-23): `correct_entry_metadata` / `correct_entry_lines_inline` RPCs, which strike-and-replace inside the same verifikat with an immutable who/when log (`journal_entry_rattelse_log`), only in open unlocked periods. Past a lock/close/declared state, storno is the only path. Never write to posted entries or their lines through any other route; never delete.
2. **All journal writes go through `lib/bookkeeping/engine.ts`.** Never insert into journal tables directly: voucher numbers are assigned atomically by the `commit_journal_entry` RPC and must stay sequential, and gaps require documented explanations (BFNAR 2013:2, `voucher_gap_explanations`).
3. **Every entry balances**: `sum(debits) === sum(credits)`, both `> 0`.
4. **Respect period locks.** DB triggers block writes to closed/locked periods and behind the company lock date. Don't work around them: fix the flow that tried to write there.
5. **Never delete documents linked to posted entries**: 7-year retention is a legal requirement.
6. **Money math is `Math.round(x * 100) / 100`.** Never `toFixed()`: it returns strings and rounds incorrectly, causing öre-level drift that breaks entry balance.
7. **Account numbers are strings** (`'1930'`, never `1930`). They are identifiers, not quantities; arithmetic on them is always a bug.

General prohibitions:

- **Never modify an existing migration**: schemas already shipped; create a new migration. Never touch the enforcement triggers (migration 017); they are legally required.
- **Never leave a remote DB ahead of the repo.** If you `apply_migration` (or run any DDL) against prod, staging, or a preview branch, write the byte-identical SQL into `supabase/migrations/` under the exact applied version in the same change. An applied version with no committed file is an orphan: Supabase branching aborts the next merge to `main` with "Remote migration versions not found in local migrations directory" and blocks every pending migration behind it. The PR preview passes anyway (preview branches fork from prod's history, which already has the orphan), so this only surfaces at merge.
- **Core code must never import from `@/extensions/`.** CI builds core with zero extensions enabled; a direct import breaks that build. Extensions cannot use dynamic imports (the registry generates static imports via `setup:extensions`).
- **Don't add dependencies without asking.** This is an AGPL-3.0 project; license compatibility matters, and the dependency surface is audited.
- **Don't "finish" the gnubok → Accounted rename.** Wire-format identifiers keep the old name on purpose: `gnubok-company-id` cookie, `gnubok_sk_`/`gnubok_inv_` prefixes, and the `gnubok-mcp` compatibility package. Renaming or removing them breaks live sessions, API keys, invites, and existing MCP connections. New MCP installs use the additive `accounted-mcp` package and `accounted_*` aliases.
- **Treat `.env.local` as pointing at the production database.** Never run seed/cleanup/repair scripts against it without explicit confirmation.
- **Keep the diff scoped to the request.** No drive-by refactors of untouched code.
- **Never use em dashes (—) or en dashes (–)** in code, comments, commit messages, or docs. Use a colon, comma, semicolon, or plain hyphen instead, whichever fits the sentence. Exception: a dash character that is the literal subject being parsed, matched, or documented (e.g. mojibake byte-mapping tables, a date-range separator regex) stays as-is; don't launder those into a colon.
- Never create a NUL/nul file: `\Accounted\NUL`.

## When Uncertain

- **Stop and ask; do not guess.** Especially for anything touching posted entries, the production database, money math, or Swedish tax law.
- **Swedish domain questions are never answered from training data.** Load the matching `swedish-*` skill (vat, accounting-compliance, invoice-compliance, payroll, year-end-closing, sie-import-export, sru-filing, financial-reporting, asset-accounting, project-accounting, tax-planning, e-invoicing).
- Scaffolding has skills; use them instead of improvising: `/supabase-migration` (migrations), `/create-extension` (extensions), `/frontend-design` (new UI), `vercel:deploy` (deployment). API routes follow `.claude/rules/api-routes.md`, which loads automatically under `app/api/`.

## Fix From First Principles

A reported problem usually arrives with a proposed solution: the reporter's workaround, the issue author's fix shape, the obvious patch at the line that broke. Treat it as evidence about the pain, not as the spec. Before implementing, answer three questions and put the answers in the PR body:

1. **Why did the problem occur?** Name the mechanism, not the symptom. A wrong number in one place usually means the definition lives in several places; a bypassed check usually means the invariant lives only in application code; a confusing label usually means a field nobody reads. Fix at the level that stops the class of bug, not the instance that was reported.
2. **What could be removed or simplified instead?** A counter that cannot be wrong because it is gone, a policy dropped instead of a check added, one write path instead of a third copy of a formula, a constraint instead of a trigger. The solution with fewer states and less code wins unless something concrete needs the extra state.
3. **Is this the best solution, or just the proposed one?** Write down the alternative you considered and why you did not take it. When the better answer removes or changes something users see (a column, a field, a limit), state both options with a recommendation: that choice is the founder's, and the PR should make it easy to take either way.

When the chosen path differs from the one proposed in the issue, record it in `DECISIONS.md` (see Decision Log).

## Definition of Done

A change is done when all of these hold; iterate until they do:

1. `npm run lint` is clean and `npm test` passes (`npx vitest run <dir>` while iterating).
2. New or changed logic in `lib/` or `app/api/` has tests: auth 401, validation 400, 404, happy path; mock `@/lib/supabase/server`.
3. Any change to a trigger, RPC, RLS policy, or DEFERRABLE constraint ships with a `*.pg.test.ts` (`npm run test:pg`).
4. New UI strings exist in **both** `messages/sv.json` and `messages/en.json`.
5. If you edited an atom `SKILL.md`, `npm run skills:generate` was run (CI's `skills:check` fails otherwise).
6. `npm run check:guards` passes if you touched API routes.
7. Commit is conventional (`feat:`/`fix:`/`refactor:`/`test:`/`docs:`), atomic, branched from `main`.
8. If the change touches migrations, local and prod are reconciled: every version in prod's `schema_migrations` has a matching file in `supabase/migrations/`, and vice versa. Check before opening the PR (e.g. `list_migrations` / `select version from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`); a remote-only version means an uncommitted orphan that will fail the merge.
9. **The last mile is verified in-session, not assumed.** Whatever was built is confirmed switched on before the session ends: merged PR's migration applied to prod, scheduled loop/routine observed firing, script actually executed, feature reachable. If switch-on must wait, the session's final output states exactly what is NOT live yet and who flips it. History shows the expensive failure mode is built-but-never-initiated, not built-wrong.
10. The PR body answers the three questions in [Fix From First Principles](#fix-from-first-principles): why the problem occurred, what removal or simplification was considered, and why the chosen solution is the best one rather than the proposed one.

```

## Architecture

- **Journal entry lifecycle**: `createDraftEntry()` → `commitEntry()` (atomic voucher via `commit_journal_entry` RPC); `createJournalEntry()` does both. Everything accounting-shaped routes through this engine.
- **Tenancy**: every business table has `company_id`. Active company resolves in `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` from `user_preferences.active_company_id` (authoritative: RLS reads the same value via `current_active_company_id()`), falling back to first non-archived membership. The `gnubok-company-id` cookie is written as a hint for legacy read paths but deliberately no longer read: letting it override the DB would desync Next.js from RLS. RLS uses `user_company_ids()`; queries still filter by `company_id` explicitly (defense in depth: service-role paths have no RLS).
- **Auth**: Supabase email+password + TOTP MFA, enforced **application-side**, not in RLS. `NEXT_PUBLIC_REQUIRE_MFA=true` on hosted; `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_HOSTED=true` disables MFA. Hosted browser sessions also have signed server-enforced idle/absolute limits (`lib/auth/session-timeout.ts`); API-key and MCP bearer surfaces are exempt. API routes wrap `withRouteContext`: it is the only path that enforces MFA, so never hand-roll `supabase.auth.getUser()` in a route.
- **Events**: `lib/events/bus.ts` is a module-level singleton. Any route that emits events must call `ensureInitialized()` (`lib/init.ts`) at module level: otherwise extension handlers are never wired and events silently go nowhere.
- **Supabase clients**: browser `client.ts`, server `createClient()`, service role `createServiceClient()`, cookieless service role `createServiceClientNoCookies()` (lives in `lib/auth/api-keys.ts`; for API-key/MCP paths). Paginate with `fetchAllRows()`: PostgREST silently caps at 1000 rows.
- **Extensions**: opt-in plugins in `extensions/general/<name>/`; `extensions.config.json` is the source of truth for what's enabled. Core must run with zero extensions.
- **MCP server**: the bookkeeping engine is exposed as 150+ MCP tools (`extensions/general/mcp-server/`), authenticated by `gnubok_sk_` API keys (SHA-256, scoped, default 100 RPM per key).
- **Types**: import from `@/types` (`types/index.ts`); event types in `lib/events/types.ts`.
- **User-facing errors are Swedish**: map through `lib/errors/get-error-message.ts`.
- **Cron**: hosted cron jobs live in `vercel.json`, authenticated via `verifyCronSecret()` (`lib/auth/cron.ts`).

## Repository Map

- `lib/bookkeeping/`: engine, entry generators, mapping, templates, BAS 2026 data (`bas-data/`)
- `lib/core/`: period, year-end, storno, tax codes, audit, documents
- `lib/events/`, `lib/auth/`, `lib/supabase/`, `lib/api/` (Zod `validateBody`/`validateQuery`)
- `lib/reports/`: balance sheet, income statement, trial balance, GL, ledgers, VAT, SIE, INK2, NE-bilaga, salary, …
- `lib/invoices/`, `lib/transactions/`, `lib/import/`, `lib/documents/`, `lib/salary/`, `lib/reconciliation/`, `lib/tax/`, `lib/vat/`, `lib/providers/` (Fortnox/Bokio/Briox/BL/Visma), `lib/skatteverket/`, `lib/currency/`, `lib/bankgiro/`, `lib/deadlines/`, `lib/calendar/`
- `lib/utils.ts`: `cn()`, `formatCurrency()`, `formatDate()`, `formatOrgNumber()`; `lib/logger.ts`
- `app/(dashboard)/*` pages; `app/api/*` routes; `supabase/migrations/` schema; `extensions/general/*` plugins

## Testing

Vitest 4, `node` env, tests in `__tests__/`, scope `lib/` + `app/api/` (no component/E2E tests). Helpers in `tests/helpers.ts`: `createMockSupabase()`, `createQueuedMockSupabase()`, `createMockRequest()`, `parseJsonResponse()`, plus fixture factories (`makeTransaction`, `makeJournalEntry`, `makeInvoice`, …). `vi.clearAllMocks()` + `eventBus.clear()` in `beforeEach`. Trigger/RPC/RLS behavior is tested in `*.pg.test.ts` against real Postgres, not with mocks.

## Detail Loads On Demand

Don't duplicate these here; they auto-load when you touch matching paths:

- `.claude/rules/design.md`: design system, locked tokens (`app/**`, `components/**`)
- `.claude/rules/i18n.md`: sv/en conventions, "stays Swedish" surfaces
- `.claude/rules/api-routes.md`: `withRouteContext` route pattern, endpoint map (`app/api/**`)
- `.claude/rules/database.md`: migration rules, key tables/RPCs/triggers, pg-real (`supabase/migrations/**`)
- `.claude/rules/mcp-server.md`: MCP tool authoring, staged-operation pattern
- `.claude/rules/bookkeeping.md`: BAS accounts, VAT treatments/rutor, `lib/core/` services

## Decision Log

When you make a non-obvious choice (picked approach A over B, declined a dependency, stopped because a rule here forbade something), append one line of at most 300 characters to `DECISIONS.md` (repo root): `[YYYY-MM-DD] <decision>: <why>`; the detail belongs in the PR body. Check that file before re-litigating a past decision (entries before 2026-08-01 are archived in git history, see its header).
