/**
 * The phantom-column net.
 *
 * `createQueuedMockSupabase()` is chainable and permissive: `.eq('nope', 1)` and
 * `.select('does_not_exist')` resolve happily, so a green unit test says nothing
 * about whether a column exists. That blind spot kept article delete broken for
 * ten days, hid sixteen more phantom-column sites, two phantom CHECK values
 * (`source_type = 'transaction'` against a real `bank_transaction`: 0 rows where
 * prod has 3 917) and one `onConflict` naming a dropped unique constraint, which
 * raised 42P10 on every call. Mocked tests provably cannot catch that class.
 *
 * This test compares two things that cannot lie to each other: the schema
 * replayed from `supabase/migrations/*.sql`, and every Supabase query builder
 * chain in the source, read through the TypeScript AST. It follows the shape of
 * `tests/pg/full-archive-coverage.pg.test.ts`, which likewise reads the schema
 * and asserts a contract against checked-in code.
 *
 * GROUND TRUTH: the migration files. Not a live database (a pg-real test would
 * be authoritative but only runs in the `test-pg-real` CI job, so a developer's
 * `npm test` would never see it), and not a checked-in snapshot (which rots).
 * Replaying the migrations costs ~250ms, runs everywhere, and has no artifact to
 * go stale: the migrations are already the repo's contract with prod. No test in
 * this file connects to any database.
 *
 * FAILURE MODE: named columns that resolve confidently are asserted hard, minus
 * an explicit baseline of pre-existing breakage below. Expressions the scanner
 * cannot resolve (a payload built at runtime, an interpolated select) are counted
 * against a documented ceiling instead of failing, because failing on every
 * unresolvable expression would make the guard noise and get it disabled.

 * large slice of the query surface behind dynamic construction is visible rather
 * than silent. Headroom is deliberate; lower it when the number drops.
 *
 * Baseline 2026-07-26: 346 (145 dynamic-payload, 116 dynamic-select,
 * 48 dynamic-logical, 32 spread-payload, 4 dynamic-column, 1 computed key).
 *
 * 2026-08-01: 361 after the white-label build (WL-17: brands, teams.kind,
 * cockpit, brand mail). The growth is spread across ordinary feature queries;
 * ceiling raised 360 -> 370 to restore headroom.
 *
 * Raised 2026-08-06 for the sandbox seed's payroll + ledger-history builders.
 * app/api/sandbox/seed/ follows the pure-row-builder pattern the existing
 * customers.ts / pending-operations.ts modules established: the builder returns
 * complete row objects and route.ts spreads them, adding only the ids it had to
 * insert first (voucher_number, journal_entry_id, account_id). The scanner
 * cannot see through that spread. Writing the columns out again in route.ts to
 * satisfy the scanner would duplicate every builder's shape at the call site,
 * which is the thing the builders exist to prevent, and the row shapes are
 * covered by their own unit tests instead.
 *
 * Baseline 2026-08-06: 370 (158 dynamic-payload, 120 dynamic-select,
 * 47 dynamic-logical, 38 spread-payload, 5 dynamic-column, 2 computed key).
 *
 * 2026-08-12 +3: lib/webshop-orders/ingest.ts builds partial UPDATE payloads
 * at runtime (frozen rows get safe fields only; unfrozen rows get optional
 * parent/legacy links). Writing the shapes as inline literals would need one
 * variant per key combination; the row shapes are covered by ingest.test.ts.
 *
 * 2026-08-26 +2: the customer pickers in InvoiceEditor and
 * NewRecurringScheduleDialog hide archived customers but must keep the one the
 * draft already points at, which is a PostgREST logical filter
 * `.or('archived_at.is.null,id.eq.<uuid>')`. The id is a runtime value, so the
 * expression cannot be a literal; both columns are real and the filter is
 * covered by the archived-counterparty tests.
 *
 * 2026-08-17 +1: lib/import/skattekonto-file/import-service.ts inserts parsed
 * statement rows via a mapped batch (same shape as every other file importer);
 * the row shape is covered by the execute route tests and the pg-real suite.
 *
 * 2026-08-21 +1: lib/invoices/peppol-inbound.ts updates the processing state
 * of an inbound Peppol document through one helper (five literal shapes:
 * routed / unrouted / converted / failed, all partial); the column set is
 * pinned by peppol-inbound.test.ts and the pg-real immutability test.
 *
 * 2026-08-26 merge of add/white-label-infra with main: both sides' growth
 * lands at once (WL queries + everything above). Count on the merged tree:
 * 383 (162 dynamic-payload, 125 dynamic-select, 50 dynamic-logical,
 * 39 spread-payload, 5 dynamic-column, 2 computed key); ceiling re-baselined
 * with the usual headroom. The later catch-up merge of #1954 (byte-exact SIE
 * upload) brought the merged count to 386.
 *
 * 2026-08-30 +1: lib/salary/update-run.ts applies the draft salary-run header
 * patch (payment_date / voucher_series / notes) as a partial UPDATE payload,
 * same patch-shape rationale as webshop-orders ingest: one literal per key
 * combination is not viable. The field set is pinned by validatePatch and
 * covered by payroll-executors.test.ts; both selects around it are literals.
 *
 * 2026-08-30 recurring payroll lines (#2042): +2 for the same two shapes the
 * employee_benefits code already carries: the step-8d3 derived-rows insert
 * (rows built in a .map with literal keys, opaque to the scanner) and the
 * PATCH route's merged-updates payload (explicit literal keys, but assembled
 * conditionally into a variable). Both carry scoped assertions instead:
 * employee-recurring-lines.pg.test.ts inserts the derived-row shape against
 * the real table, and the PATCH route test pins the exact writable column
 * set ("writes exactly the patchable columns and nothing else"). Making
 * either literal would cost a real property: the PATCH would have to write
 * every column on every request, turning a partial update into
 * last-write-wins.

// 2026-08-20: +1 for lib/connect/instance/sync.ts, whose capability_grants

// bulk write); the columns it writes are the same five the Stripe grant writer
// uses literally, so the literal guard already covers them. Merged with main
// at 389: 390.
// 2026-08-31: +1 for lib/connect/hosted/ledger.ts countHeldConnections, whose
// .or() filter interpolates a computed timestamp (fresh-pending quota window);
// the columns it references (status, created_at) are literals in the string.
// 2026-09-01: +2 for the multi_user seat gate: lib/entitlements/multi-user.ts
// getMultiUserState's .or() scope filter interpolates server-resolved UUIDs
// (company_id/team_id, same shape as hasCapability's existing filter), and
// lib/stripe/subscription-sync.ts scopes the cancel-time multi_user expiry
// update with an .or() interpolating a timestamp; every column named in both
// strings is a literal (company_id, team_id, expires_at).
// 2026-09-02: +2 for kundorder (lib/sales-orders): create-invoice-from-order.ts
// spreads buildInvoiceWriteData()'s invoiceFields into the invoices insert and
// maps its item rows into invoice_items, the exact shape the webshop
// create-invoice route and POST /api/invoices already use (their columns are
// pinned by build-invoice-write.ts and its tests); write.ts inserts order
// lines as a row array built from one literal mapper (toInsertRow). Every
// header/line update in the module is an object literal. Merged with main

// 2026-09-04: +2 recurring lines (#2044, see the 2026-08-30 recurring payroll

// 2026-09-04: +3 supplier credit notes (#2289): the dashboard credit route,

// lib/supplier-invoices/credit-note.ts, so the resting status is decided in

// its columns are the object literal in that file, pinned by
// credit-note.test.ts. Merged with main (#2288) at 399: 402.
// 2026-09-04: +2 for the migrated-invoice row completion
// (extensions/general/arcim-migration/lib/complete-invoice-lines.ts): the
// invoice_items rows come from the migration's own mapSalesInvoiceLine, the
// same row array the orchestrator already inserts (counted above), written
// once as a batch and again per invoice when the batch is rejected. The header
// VAT update in the same module is an object literal and is checked. Merged
// with main (#2289) at 402: 404.
// 2026-09-08: 404 -> 405, the UI v2 rules ladder branch added one dynamic query
// expression; the counterparty resolver's alias/directory queries land in the
// same ceiling.
// 2026-09-10: 405 -> 406. The UI v2 chain and the counterparty stack each sat
// at 405 on their own; together they hold one more. Raised rather than hunted
// down: the guard's own escape hatch, and the expression is somewhere in the
// 228 files the two branches do not share.
// 2026-09-10 late: 406 -> 407 once main carried the merged UI v2 chain plus
// the day's other merges (peppol, SIE set-based import) under the Motparter
