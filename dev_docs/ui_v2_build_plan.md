# UI v2 build plan: from the "Hela året" prototype to the product

Written 2026-09-07. Source: the prototype at claude.ai/code/artifact/8937d889 (v19), built on Kick's layout in Accounted's design system, and the founder decisions taken the same day (DECISIONS.md, 2026-09-07). This document is the sequence and the models; the prototype is the picture.

## Decisions this plan rests on

1. Shell v2 is full-bleed: no centered column, page title in a 48 px top bar, primary action top-right. Per-user opt-in until it is the default.
2. Home is one queue: Att göra on `lib/worklist` plus `pending_operations`. Ingest creates the proposal, so every row arrives with a suggestion. Object pages become registers.
3. Autopilot is allowed as an opt-in per company. A rule may book on its own after five hits without a correction. Proposals-only stays the default.
4. One rules model. The three learning systems merge into one table and one word in the UI: Regler.
5. Receipt chasing (card-to-person asks) is designed but not built now.
6. Supplier invoices get "in payment file" and "reconciled" states, shaped so in-system payment initiation can replace the bank-file step later.
7. Cheap removals: the defer-booking toggle, the Ny verifikation sub-doors, attest hidden for kontantmetod companies.

## Sequence

Each PR is independent and reviewable. The order follows dependency, not page order.

### PR 1: shell v2 behind a flag (this PR)

- `user_preferences.ui_state.shell` ('v1' | 'v2'), written from Inställningar → Konto → Layout.
- Layout renders `data-shell` on `#main-content`; `MainContainer` drops the max-width in v2.
- `PageHeader` keeps its markup and becomes the top bar through `[data-shell="v2"]` CSS. No page is edited, and v1 is byte-identical.
- design.md conventions 1, 2 and 9 carry the addendum.

Done when: any page renders in both shells, the toggle persists, lint and tests are green.

### PR 2: sidebar and top bar to the prototype's proportions

- Sidebar 220 px with 15 px icons, company chip at the top, Enheter group.
- The avatar menu stays at the bottom of the sidebar in PR 2; moving it and the plus into the top bar is part of PR 9 (cutover polish), since the top bar is the page header and lives inside each page.
- Nav IA: Att göra, Aktivitet, then Konton, Transaktioner, Fakturering, Inköp, Bokföring, Löner, Skatt, Rapporter, Bokslut. Sub-pages become section pickers in the toolbar row instead of nav items.

### PR 3: Att göra as three panes on the worklist

**Superseded 2026-09-10.** The three panes were tried on the preview and dropped: Att göra in shell v2 is Hem (greeting, notices, checklist, Att göra + Fortsätt panes) stretched to the full-bleed panel. `lib/worklist/tasks-v2.ts`, `components/attgora/*` and the `att_gora_v2` strings beyond the top bar's title and help are deleted.

- Left: task tree grouped Löpande / Stäng månad / Moms / Bokslut with counts, from `lib/worklist` categories plus `pending_operations` ("Assistentens förslag").
- Middle: the task detail, starting with Granska utgående and Granska inkommande (row-centric review, approve selected).
- Right: Detaljer (deadline, lagrum), Beroenden, task-scoped assistant message.
- Dependencies come from the worklist's done conditions, not from new state.
- Requires propose-at-ingest: the categorisation pipeline writes a proposal on arrival instead of on open.

Shipped scope (PR 3a): the three panes on the real worklist (`lib/worklist/tasks-v2.ts` builds the tree from the counts; groups Kom igång / Löpande / Bevaka / Skatt). Middle-pane lists with actions: suggested matches (Bekräfta), supplier invoices (Attestera, Attestera alla), agent proposals (Godkänn / Avvisa). Lists that show rows and open their page: transactions, inbox documents, expense payouts, overdue invoices, deadlines, bank consent. Link-only for now: skattekonto rows, verifikat without documents, accounts to reconcile. Row-centric transaction review with approve-in-place lands with PR 4's table (PR 3b embeds it here). The right pane reads deadline, lagrum and dependencies from the model and shows a task-scoped assistant line with "Fråga assistenten" (opens the agent sheet with general.help). Not a chat thread yet.

### PR 4: Transaktioner table

- Columns: checkbox, Datum, Beskrivning, Kategori (icon), Klass, Konto (institution mark), Belopp, Enhet, Åtgärd. Column settings (order, pin, hide) and saved views in `ui_state`.
- Inline category picker that offers the rule dialog after a change ("Accounted hittade N liknande").
- Right drawer for a row; match view for transfers.

Shipped scope (PR 4a): the inbox table gains Kategori and Konto columns in shell v2, with per-user column visibility (`ui_state.tx_columns`, gear in the toolbar, `lib/transactions/columns-v2.ts`). The Kategori cell shows the match hint the row already carries (invoice, supplier invoice, ROT/RUT payout, utlägg, verifikat) or prompts "Välj kategori" and opens the existing review dialog. Konto shows bank plus the account's last digits. `ShellProvider` / `useShell()` let client pages branch on the shell. Still to come: the rule dialog after a category change (with PR 5's rules model), drag-to-reorder and saved views, the right drawer and the transfer match view (PR 4b), and the same columns on the history list.

### PR 5: one rules model

Migration `rules` (per company):

| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| id, company_id | |
| when | jsonb list of conditions: counterparty, text contains, direction, amount range, account |
| then | jsonb list of actions: category/account, VAT treatment, template, class or dimension, document expectation, question to ask |
| origin | 'correction' \| 'repetition' \| 'answer' \| 'system' \| 'manual' |
| origin_ref | verifikat or transaction id the rule was born from |
| mode | 'proposed' \| 'propose' \| 'auto' \| 'paused' |
| hits, corrections | counters, updated when a match is approved or changed |
| last_match_at, last_match_ref | |
| created_at, updated_at, edited_note | |

- Backfill: categorization_templates and counterparty templates become rows with origin 'repetition' or 'correction'; booking_template_library entries become templates a `then` action can reference.
- Mode ladder: proposed → propose (user confirms) → auto (five hits, zero corrections, company autopilot on). A correction sets paused.
- Amounts over the company's confirm threshold (default 10 000 kr) are always confirmed regardless of mode.
- UI: Regler page with the four-step bar, sentence rows, and a rule page (Om / Gör / Utom, "Så här läser Accounted regeln", matches this year, origin, trust, links).
- Agents: the same table behind `list_rules` and the existing categorisation tools.

Shipped scope (PR 5a): no new table. `categorization_templates` already is the per-counterparty rule (aliases, accounts, VAT, occurrence_count, confidence, source), so the ladder lives there: migration 20260907121500 adds `mode` (proposed / propose / auto / paused), `corrections` and `paused_at`, with a BEFORE trigger that keeps `mode` and `is_active` in step both ways (soft-delete reads as paused, a paused rule stops matching). `insertOrUpdateTemplate` counts corrections. `lib/rules` (model + service), `/api/rules` and `/api/rules/[id]` (GET, PATCH mode), the Regler page with the ladder bar and sentence rows, and the rule page (Om / Gör, "Så här läser Accounted regeln", this year's matches by bank text, origin, trust, links). Regler is a sub-item under Transaktioner in the v2 sidebar. Still to come: 'auto' is refused by the API until the autopilot tier (PR 5b: company opt-in + rule-driven auto-commit under the autonomy envelope); 'proposed' rules (suggest before confirm) need the repetition detector to write mode = proposed instead of activating (PR 5c); the rule dialog after a category change on Transaktioner; merging booking_template_library into a `then` action (it stays Mallar for now).

### PR 6: Inköp lifecycle

- `SupplierInvoiceStatus` gains `in_payment_file` and `reconciled`. Betalfil batches already exist; "in payment file" is set when a batch includes the invoice, "reconciled" when the bank row is matched in reconciliation.
- Payment initiation later: the step "I betalfil" becomes "Betalas" with two implementations (file to bank, or initiation through the bank connection). The state machine does not change, only the actor.
- Pipeline bar on the list with counts per step, the invoice page with document, kontering, betalning and kopplat, one primary per step.
- Kontantmetod companies do not see attest.

Shipped scope (PR 6a): no new status values. The stage is DERIVED (`lib/supplier-invoices/stages.ts` + `lifecycle-stages.ts`): status and approved_at on the invoice, membership in an open payment batch = "I betalfil", the paying bank row = "Betald", and an account sign-off through that row's date = "Avstämd". `GET /api/supplier-invoices/lifecycle` returns the stage per invoice plus counts. In shell v2 the Inköp list shows the six-step bar with counts (click filters) instead of the status picker, and the invoice page opens with the flow strip (dates on done steps, what is still needed on the rest). Kontantmetod companies: no attest action on either page and no Attesterad step on their ladder. When payment initiation arrives, "I betalfil" reads its evidence from the initiated payment instead of the batch; the enum and the pages do not change.

### PR 7: Underlag

- Inkorg with the pipeline bar and the "Tar emot från" channel line (existing intake address, WhatsApp when live, Peppol, upload).
- Underlag rows link to the bank row or the invoice they belong to; "Svara vad det var" creates the own document per BFL 5 kap. 6–7 §§.
- Chasing is out of scope in this PR (decision 5).

Shipped scope (PR 7a): in shell v2 the Dokumentinkorg workspace opens with the flow bar Inkommet → Tolkat → Matchat → Bokfört → Arkiverat, counted from the rows it already holds and wired to the status filters it already has (all / todo / linked / booked). The "källor" chip in the header remains the "Tar emot från" line (mailboxes, WhatsApp number, last searched). "Svara vad det var" is the existing Bokför direkt path. Chasing is not built (decision 5).

### PR 8: registers as lists

Fakturering, Bokföring, Löner, Skatt, Rapporter, Bokslut and Konton get the toolbar row, the section picker and the one-line table. Existing editors stay. This is the long tail and can be split per page.

Shipped scope (PR 8a): every list page that drew its own title (Kundfakturor, Leverantörsfakturor, Kunder, Leverantörer, Artiklar, Anläggningstillgångar, Dimensioner, Löner, Anställda, Kundorder, Granskning, Årsbokslut, Transaktioner's status bar, Kontoplan) now carries the `page-header` class hooks, so in shell v2 its title and primary action sit in the top bar like every PageHeader page; v1 is untouched. New page `/accounts` (Konton): bank accounts and the skattekonto from the reconciliation service with source, last read, signed-off-through, rows to review and balance, each row linking into the reconciliation for that account. The v2 sidebar gets Konton first under BOLAGET (Översikt, Bankkonton, Skattekonto, Avstämning). Still to come per page: section pickers replacing in-page tab rows, one-line rows where lists still stack secondary text (PR 8b onwards).

### PR 9: cutover

Shell v2 becomes the default, v1 is removed, design.md conventions 1, 2 and 9 lose their addenda and state v2 plainly.

Split in two. PR 9a (this): the default flips to v2; a user who prefers Standard keeps it through Inställningar → Konto → Layout. Merge last, after the preview walk-through of PRs 1 to 8. PR 9b (later, after a few weeks of v2 as default): remove the v1 branches (`MainContainer` v1, the v1 sidebar with its collapse rail and folds, the v1 Hem with `DashboardContent`/`AttGoraSection`/`ResumePane`, the status pickers the pipeline bars replaced), drop the flag and the `data-shell` CSS scoping, and rewrite design.md conventions 1, 2 and 9 without addenda.

## What the prototype fakes and the product must do for real

- Assistant answers (canned in the prototype): task-scoped opening message from worklist data, questions to the existing assistant.
- Live categorisation and OCR: the existing pipelines, with proposals written at ingest.
- "Bokför själv": auto-commit through the engine under the autonomy envelope, only when company autopilot is on and the rule is in mode auto.
- Activity: `processing_history`, never `event_log`.

## Out of scope for now

Receipt chasing and card-to-person mapping, Kivra and Gmail scanning, the byrå shell beyond the Klienter list, mobile layout for the three-pane home (the right pane collapses below 1240 px in the prototype; the product needs a real mobile answer before PR 3 ships to phones).
