# Periods and registers endpoints

Fiscal periods and their lock/close/year-end lifecycle (async operations), the BAS chart of accounts, cost-center/project dimensions, the compliance pre-flight check, and reading filed VAT declarations (and beslut) from Skatteverket.

Conventions (auth, envelope, pagination, dry-run, idempotency, standard errors)
are in SKILL.md and are not repeated per endpoint.

### `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/accounts`

**List chart-of-accounts entries (BAS chart).**
`scope:reports:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Returns the company's own chart of accounts (kontoplan), ordered by account_number, which is the BAS sequence (a longer sub-account number such as 19301 sorts directly after 1930). This is not the full BAS 2026 catalogue: a new company starts with a small set of accounts seeded for its company form, and standard BAS accounts join the chart when the user activates them, when an import brings them in, or automatically the first time a verifikat posts to one. Filter with ?class=<0-9>, the first digit of account_number: 1 assets; 2 equity, untaxed reserves and liabilities; 3 operating revenue; 4 goods, materials and subcontracted services; 5 external expenses for premises, leasing, energy, consumables, repairs, vehicles, freight, travel, and advertising and PR; 6 other external expenses such as selling costs, office supplies, telecom, insurance, administration, accounting, IT and consulting services, and hired staff; 7 personnel costs, plus write-downs and depreciation (77xx-78xx); 8 financial items, year-end appropriations (88xx), and tax and the year's result (89xx). Classes 0 and 9 are outside BAS's 1-8 (free for company use) and appear only on internal accounts, typically carried over from an imported chart. Only active accounts are returned by default; pass ?active=false to include deactivated ones.

**Use when:** You need account numbers and names to render verifikation tables, build a custom report, check that an account is active before booking to it, or look up an account's type, normal balance, SRU code or VAT defaults.
**Do not use for:** Fetching balances: use the trial-balance report. Creating, renaming or deactivating accounts: v1 has no account write endpoint. Use the Kontoplan (chart of accounts) page in the app, or the MCP tools accounted_create_account and accounted_update_account, which stage the change for approval.

**Pitfalls:**
- account_number is a STRING: "1930", not 1930. BAS numbers have four digits; a chart imported from another system can also carry longer sub-account numbers such as "19301".
- An account missing from this list is not necessarily unusable. Posting to a standard BAS 2026 account that is not in the chart adds it automatically; posting to a deactivated account, or to a non-BAS number the chart does not contain, fails with ACCOUNTS_NOT_IN_CHART.
- is_system_account=true marks the accounts seeded when the company was created (such as 1510, 1930, 2440, 2611 and 3001). They cannot be deleted and bulk deactivation skips them, but they can still be renamed and deactivated one at a time.
- normal_balance belongs to the account, not to account_type: contra accounts go against their type, such as 1219 (accumulated depreciation, an asset with a credit balance) and 3730 (discounts given, revenue with a debit balance).
- default_vat_rate is a fraction (0, 0.06, 0.12 or 0.25), not a percentage. default_vat_treatment overrides the built-in BAS mapping for the momsdeklaration and is null unless someone set it; it can only be set on class 3 (sales treatments) and classes 4-6 (reverse-charge purchase treatments).
- sort_order is a stored display hint, not a sequence to rely on: every account seeded at company creation carries 0. The list already comes in BAS order.
- Deactivated accounts are excluded by default; pass ?active=false to include them. A deactivated account keeps its history and balances but cannot be used on new verifikat.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `class` | query | `string` | no | Account class, the first digit of account_number (0-9). BAS uses 1-8; 0 and 9 appear only on internal accounts, typically carried over from an imported chart. |
| `active` | query | `"true" \| "false"` | no | false also returns deactivated accounts. Default: active accounts only. |

### `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/compliance/check`

**Run a structured compliance pre-flight check.**
`scope:compliance:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Generalised pre-flight that consolidates the Accounted pre-close validators under one envelope. Supported check types: year_end_readiness (BFNAR 2017:3 + ÅRL 2:1 blockers), voucher_gaps (BFNAR 2013:2 kap 8 § series continuity). vat_close is planned for a follow-up PR (the underlying function currently lives in the MCP extension and core routes cannot import from extensions; it will be extracted into lib/reports/ then exposed here). New types can be added without changing the response shape.

**Use when:** Before committing to an irreversible action (VAT close, year-end close), or as a periodic audit sweep to surface blockers before they become urgent.
**Do not use for:** Executing the underlying action: this is read-only. After a passing check, call the corresponding async endpoint (POST /fiscal-periods/{id}/year-end, etc).

**Pitfalls:**
- year_end_readiness and voucher_gaps require fiscal_period_id (UUID).
- voucher_gaps covers EVERY voucher series registered for the period (A, B, F, ...), not only series A.
- A passing check is a SNAPSHOT: the state can change between the check and the action. The same blocker logic runs again on commit.
- vat_close is documented in the plan but NOT yet supported by this endpoint: call gnubok_vat_close_check via the MCP server until the function is extracted into lib/reports/.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `type` | query | `"year_end_readiness" \| "voucher_gaps"` | yes | Which check to run. |
| `fiscal_period_id` | query | `string` | yes | Fiscal period to check (id from GET /fiscal-periods). Both current check types require it. |

Response `200`:

### `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/dimensions`

**List dimensions (kostnadsställe/projekt) with their values.**
`scope:reports:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Returns the company's dimension registry: SIE #DIM entries keyed by sie_dim_no (1 = Kostnadsställe, 6 = Projekt; both always exist): with the registered values (#OBJEKT) nested under each dimension. Dimensions are ordered by sort_order, values by code. Line-level tags on journal entries reference these values as {"<sie_dim_no>":"<code>"} in the `dimensions` map.

**Use when:** You need the valid dimension value codes before tagging journal-entry lines with a cost centre or project, or you are rendering a dimension picker.
**Do not use for:** Filtering reports (pass the dimension filter to the report endpoints once available) or reading which lines carry a tag (read the journal entries themselves).

**Pitfalls:**
- Dimension value codes are STRINGS and case-sensitive: "P001", not 1.
- sie_dim_no is the key used in journal_entry_lines.dimensions, NOT the dimension row id.
- is_active=false values are historical (archived): do not tag new lines with them.
- resets_annually=true (dim 1) means balances reset each fiscal year; dim 6 (projekt) accumulates across years.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |

Response `200`:
```ts
{
  data: {
    dimensions: { id: string, sie_dim_no: number, name: string, resets_annually: boolean, is_system: boolean, is_active: boolean, sort_order: number, values: { id: string, code: string, name: string, is_active: boolean, start_date: string | null, end_date: string | null }[] }[]

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/dimensions/{id}/values`

**Create a dimension value (kostnadsställe/projekt code).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:low · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Registers a new value (SIE #OBJEKT) under a dimension: e.g. a new project code under dimension 6. Requires Idempotency-Key (UUID). Supports ?dry_run=true to validate the code format without committing. The `:id` path segment is the dimension row id (from GET …/dimensions), not the sie_dim_no. Duplicate codes within the dimension return 409 DIMENSION_VALUE_DUPLICATE_CODE.

**Use when:** A voucher or invoice references a cost centre / project code that does not exist yet and the user has confirmed it should be created.
**Do not use for:** Renaming or archiving an existing value (dashboard register in v1). Tagging lines: pass the dimensions map on the journal-entry line instead.

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory: calls without it return 400 VALIDATION_ERROR.
- The :id segment is the dimension UUID, not the SIE dimension number.
- Codes are limited to the strict Fortnox charset (A-Ö, digits, _, +, -; max 20 chars) even though historical imported codes may be looser.
- code is immutable after creation: there is no rename in v1; create the correct code and archive the wrong one.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

  code: string,
  name: string,

### `PATCH /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/dimensions/{id}/values/{valueId}`

**Update a dimension value (rename, archive, set start/end date).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:low · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Sparse update of a dimension value (SIE #OBJEKT): name, is_active (false = archive), start_date, end_date. `code` is immutable: renaming a code would orphan every journal line tagged with it; create a new value and archive the old one instead. Dates are only allowed on accumulating dimensions (resets_annually=false, e.g. dim 6 Projekt): use end_date to close a finished project. Idempotent (mandatory Idempotency-Key) and dry-runnable.

**Use when:** You need to rename a project/cost-centre, mark a finished project with an end date, or archive (is_active=false) a value that should no longer be used on new lines.
**Do not use for:** Changing the code (immutable: create + archive instead). Removing an unused value entirely (use DELETE). Tagging lines (pass dimensions on the journal-entry line or invoice).

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- The :id segment is the dimension UUID and :valueId the value UUID (both from GET …/dimensions), not SIE numbers or codes.
- start_date/end_date return 400 DIMENSION_VALUE_DATES_NOT_ALLOWED on resets_annually dimensions (dim 1 Kostnadsställe).
- Archived values (is_active=false) still appear in GET …/dimensions and remain valid on historical lines; they are only blocked for NEW tags.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `valueId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `DELETE /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/dimensions/{id}/values/{valueId}`

**Delete an unreferenced dimension value.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:medium · idempotent`

Hard-deletes a dimension value (SIE #OBJEKT) that no journal line references. Values used on posted or reversed verifikat are retained for the BFL 7-year archive and cannot be deleted: the DB trigger blocks it and this endpoint returns 409 DIMENSION_VALUE_REFERENCED. Archive those instead (PATCH is_active=false). Requires Idempotency-Key.

**Use when:** A project/cost-centre code was created by mistake (typo, duplicate) and has never been used on any booking.
**Do not use for:** Retiring a project that has bookings: PATCH is_active=false (and optionally end_date) instead. Deleting a whole dimension (not supported).

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- 409 DIMENSION_VALUE_REFERENCED means the value is used on booked verifikat: it can never be deleted, only archived.
- Deletion is permanent: the code can be re-created afterwards, but the old row id is gone.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `valueId` | path | `string` | yes |  |

### `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods`

**List fiscal periods (räkenskapsår).**
`scope:reports:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Returns every fiscal period for the company ordered by period_start DESC. is_closed=true means bokslut has been signed; locked_at non-null means writes are blocked at the DB-trigger level.

**Use when:** You need to find the active period before booking, build a year-selector UI, or audit the period-lock history.
**Do not use for:** Creating, locking, or closing periods: those land in Phase 4 (`POST /fiscal-periods/{id}/lock`, `:close`, `:year-end`). Use the dashboard or wait for Phase 4.

**Pitfalls:**
- previous_period_id chains the bokslut continuity (BFNAR 2013:2). A null value on a non-first period is a data-quality red flag.
- A period can be locked but not closed (löpande bokföring of the new year while bokslut work continues on the prior year: see BFL 5 kap 2 § for the löpande bokföring deadline).
- BFL 3 kap caps a single fiscal period at 18 months. First-year exceptions are allowed.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |

Response `200`:
```ts
{
  data: {
    fiscal_periods: { id: string, name: string, period_start: string, period_end: string, is_closed: boolean, closed_at: string | null, locked_at: string | null, previous_period_id: string | null, created_at: string, duration_days: number, exceeds_18_months: boolean }[]

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/close`

**Close a fiscal period (IRREVERSIBLE per BFL 5 kap 8 §).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent`

Sets is_closed=true + closed_at on the period. Pre-requisites: period must be locked (call /lock first) AND year-end closing must have been executed (call /year-end first). Sync. The DB blocks any subsequent JE inserts.

**Use when:** Final step in the year-end flow: lock → year-end → close. Closing freezes the period for BFL 7 kap retention.
**Do not use for:** Locking a period (use /lock). Running the year-end closing entry (use /year-end). UNDOING a close (not supported, irreversible).

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- IRREVERSIBLE. Once is_closed=true, the period is read-only forever (BFL 5 kap 8 § + 7 kap).
- Pre-conditions: locked + closing_entry_id present. Otherwise the call returns CONFLICT.

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/currency-revaluation`

**Run FX revaluation for the fiscal period.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent · reversible`

Re-rates open foreign-currency AR (1510) and AP (2440) at the closing date's Riksbanken rate and posts the SEK delta to 3960 (valutakursvinst) / 7960 (valutakursförlust). Returns 202 with operation_id. Idempotent per-period: the engine throws if a revaluation has already been posted for the same fiscal_period_id.

**Use when:** Before /year-end if your books have open foreign-currency receivables or payables. /year-end also runs this internally, so you only need to call it separately when you want the FX-only entry without the full closing.
**Do not use for:** Re-running on the same period (CURRENCY_REVALUATION_ALREADY_EXISTS). Revaluing a closed period (the trigger blocks JE writes to closed periods).

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- Engine returns null if no open foreign-currency items exist: the operation succeeds with result.revaluation_entry_id=null.
- as_of_date defaults to period_end if omitted.

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/lock`

**Lock a fiscal period (no new entries can be posted into it).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent · reversible`

Sets locked_at on the period. Refuses if uncategorised business transactions remain in the period: they must be bokfört first. The DB trigger blocks JE inserts into locked periods; locking is the application-level pre-step before /close. Sync.

**Use when:** Finishing a period and you want to stop new postings. Step 1 of a three-step year-end flow: lock → year-end → close.
**Do not use for:** Locking an already-closed period (no-op). Bypassing the uncategorised-transactions guard: categorise or mark-private first.

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- A period with uncategorised business transactions cannot be locked; the response surfaces the count.
- Locking is reversible until /close. The unlock endpoint is not in v1; use the dashboard.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |

Response `200`:
```ts
{
  data: { id: string, locked_at: string, is_closed: boolean },
  meta: {
    request_id: string,
    api_version: string,

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/opening-balances`

**Generate opening-balance verifikation for the next fiscal period.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent · reversible`

Reads the closed period's trial balance, filters to BAS class 1-2 accounts with non-zero closing balance, and posts an opening verifikation (status=posted) onto the next_period_id. Sync. The path id is the CLOSED period; body.next_period_id is the target.

**Use when:** After /year-end + /close on a period, generate the IB into the next period so the new year starts with the correct balance sheet.
**Do not use for:** Posting opening balances on a manually-edited basis (use POST /journal-entries with source_type=manual). Re-running on the same target period (will produce duplicate IB entries).

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- next_period_id must reference the SAME company and must NOT already have an IB entry. The engine throws if it does.
- Only class 1 (assets) and 2 (equity/liabilities) flow into the IB; class 3-8 are zeroed by the closing entry.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |

Request body:
```ts
{ next_period_id: string }
```

Example request:
```json
{
  "next_period_id": "7b3a…"
}
```

Response `200`:
```ts
{
  data: { opening_entry_id: string, voucher_series: string, voucher_number: number, next_period_id: string },
  meta: {
    request_id: string,
    api_version: string,
    next_cursor?: string | null,
    audit?: { voucher_number?: string, voucher_url?: string, audit_trail_url?: string, immutable_at?: string },
    partial_expansions?: string[],
    coverage?: Record<string, unknown>
  }
}
```

{
  "data": {
    "opening_entry_id": "4d2a…",
    "voucher_series": "A",
    "voucher_number": 1,

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/year-end`

**Execute year-end closing (currency revaluation + closing entry).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent`

Async-operation endpoint. Runs the year-end closing flow: currency revaluation (FX gains/losses to 3960/7960), then posts the closing entry that zeroes class 3-8 onto årets resultat (2099 for AB, the relevant eget-kapital account in the 2010-2019 range for enskild firma: the engine resolves which based on company.entity_type). Returns 202 with operation_id; subscribe to operation.completed or poll /v1/operations/{id}.

**Use when:** After /lock and a passing /compliance/check?type=year_end_readiness, you want to run the closing entry. This is step 2 of the lock → year-end → close flow.
**Do not use for:** Re-running year-end (per-period idempotent: fails if closing_entry_id is already set). Closing the period (use /close after year-end succeeds).

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- Period must pass year_end_readiness checks (no drafts, no unexplained voucher gaps, trial balance balanced). The engine re-validates and aborts if not.
- Closing entry is itself a verifikation (posted): the period must NOT already be closed.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |

Response `200`:
```ts
{
  data: {
    operation_id: string,
    type: "fiscal_periods.year_end",
    status: "queued" | "running" | "succeeded" | "failed",
    poll_url: string,
    webhook_event: "operation.completed"
  },

    partial_expansions?: string[],

  }
}
```

### `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/skatteverket/vat-declarations`

**Read a filed momsdeklaration (submitted and/or decided) from Skatteverket.**
`scope:compliance:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Fetches the momsdeklaration for one period as Skatteverket has it on file: `submitted` is the declaration as filed (SKV /inlamnat), `decided` is Skatteverket's beslut (SKV /beslutat). Either section is null when nothing is on file for the period (or when excluded via ?state=). Query params: period_type (monthly|quarterly|yearly), year, period (1-12 monthly, 1-4 quarterly, 1 yearly), optional state (submitted|decided|both, default both). Requires the company to have an active Skatteverket connection (any member's BankID connection, or a verified ombud grant). Live read against Skatteverket, not a cached copy.

**Use when:** You want to verify what was actually filed for a VAT period, compare a period against last year's filed declaration, or check whether Skatteverket has decided a period.
**Do not use for:** Computing the declaration from the books (use the VAT report), or filing: submission is a separate BankID-signed flow.

**Pitfalls:**
- This is a live Skatteverket read: it fails with SKATTEVERKET_NOT_CONNECTED (401) when the company has neither a member's BankID connection (made under Installningar) nor a verified ombud grant, and the response reflects SKV's state, not the books. Personal BankID sessions expire after ~1 hour by design, so an expired connection is normal: ask the user to reconnect; only a person can, so do not retry until they confirm.
- submitted=null and decided=null with HTTP 200 means "nothing on file for the period": it is not an error.
- A submitted declaration can lack a beslut for days: poll decided separately rather than assuming both appear together.
- redovisningsperiod is SKV's YYYYMM format (the period's LAST month): quarterly period 1 is 03, not 01.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `period_type` | query | `"monthly" \| "quarterly" \| "yearly"` | yes |  |
| `year` | query | `number` | yes |  |
| `period` | query | `number` | yes |  |
| `state` | query | `"submitted" \| "decided" \| "both"` | no |  |
