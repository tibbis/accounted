# Periods and registers endpoints

Fiscal periods and their lock/close/year-end lifecycle (async operations), the BAS chart of accounts, cost-center/project dimensions, the compliance pre-flight check, and reading filed VAT declarations (and beslut) from Skatteverket.

Conventions (auth, envelope, pagination, dry-run, idempotency, standard errors)
are in SKILL.md and are not repeated per endpoint.

### `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/accounts`

**List chart-of-accounts entries (BAS chart).**
`scope:reports:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Returns the company's own chart of accounts (kontoplan), ordered by account_number, which is the BAS sequence (a longer sub-account number such as 19301 sorts directly after 1930). This is not the full BAS 2026 catalogue: a new company starts with a small set of accounts seeded for its company form, and standard BAS accounts join the chart when the user activates them, when an import brings them in, or automatically the first time a verifikat posts to one. Filter with ?class=<0-9>, the first digit of account_number: 1 assets; 2 equity, untaxed reserves and liabilities; 3 operating revenue; 4 goods, materials and subcontracted services; 5 external expenses for premises, leasing, energy, consumables, repairs, vehicles, freight, travel, and advertising and PR; 6 other external expenses such as selling costs, office supplies, telecom, insurance, administration, accounting, IT and consulting services, and hired staff; 7 personnel costs, plus write-downs and depreciation (77xx-78xx); 8 financial items, year-end appropriations (88xx), and tax and the year's result (89xx). Classes 0 and 9 are outside BAS's 1-8 (free for company use) and appear only on internal accounts, typically carried over from an imported chart. Only active accounts are returned by default; pass ?active=false to include deactivated ones.

**Use when:** You need account numbers and names to render verifikation tables, build a custom report, check that an account is active before booking to it, or look up an account's type, normal balance, SRU code or VAT defaults.
**Do not use for:** Fetching balances: use the trial-balance report. Creating, editing, deactivating or deleting accounts: POST /accounts, PATCH and DELETE /accounts/{number}, POST /accounts/activate and /accounts/deactivate.

**Pitfalls:**
- account_number is a STRING: "1930", not 1930. BAS numbers have four digits; a chart imported from another system can also carry longer sub-account numbers such as "19301".
- An account missing from this list is not necessarily unusable. Posting to a standard BAS 2026 account that is not in the chart adds it automatically; posting to a deactivated account, or to a non-BAS number the chart does not contain, fails with ACCOUNTS_NOT_IN_CHART.
- is_system_account=true marks the accounts seeded when the company was created (such as 1510, 1930, 2440, 2611 and 3001). They cannot be deleted and bulk deactivation skips them, but they can still be renamed and deactivated one at a time.
- normal_balance belongs to the account, not to account_type: contra accounts go against their type, such as 1219 (accumulated depreciation, an asset with a credit balance) and 3730 (discounts given, revenue with a debit balance).
- default_vat_rate is a fraction (0, 0.06, 0.12 or 0.25), not a percentage. default_vat_treatment overrides the built-in BAS mapping for the momsdeklaration and is null unless someone set it; it can only be set on class 3 (sales treatments) and classes 4-6 (reverse-charge purchase treatments).
- sort_order is a stored display hint, not a sequence to rely on: every account seeded at company creation carries 0. The list already comes in BAS order.
- Deactivated accounts are excluded by default; pass ?active=false to include them. A deactivated account keeps its history and balances but cannot be used on new verifikat.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `class` | query | `string` | no | Account class, the first digit of account_number (0-9). BAS uses 1-8; 0 and 9 appear only on internal accounts, typically carried over from an imported chart. |
| `active` | query | `"true" \| "false"` | no | false also returns deactivated accounts. Default: active accounts only. |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/accounts`

**Add an account to the chart of accounts (kontoplan).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:low · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Adds an account to the company's kontoplan. A BAS 2026 number needs nothing but the number: name, account_type, normal_balance, description and SRU code are prefilled from the catalogue, and anything you send wins. A number outside BAS 2026 must name account_name, account_type and normal_balance. account_class and account_group derive from the number. A default_vat_treatment without a default_vat_rate derives the booking rate. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** A verifikat needs an account the chart does not carry: a company-specific sub-account, or a BAS account the company has not used yet.
**Do not use for:** Reactivating a deactivated account (PATCH is_active=true, or POST /accounts/activate) or bulk-adding standard BAS accounts (POST /accounts/activate).

**Pitfalls:**
- account_number is a STRING of exactly 4 digits: "5410", not 5410.
- The account_type must fit the class, the first digit: 1 asset; 2 equity, liability or untaxed_reserves (21xx only); 3 revenue; 4-7 expense; 8 revenue or expense. A mismatch returns 400 ACCOUNT_TYPE_CLASS_CONFLICT.
- A number already in the chart returns 409 ACCOUNT_EXISTS, or ACCOUNT_EXISTS_INACTIVE when it was deactivated: reactivate it instead.
- default_vat_rate is a fraction (0, 0.06, 0.12, 0.25), not a percentage.
- vat_box (momsruta override) only fits 26xx VAT accounts other than 2650.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `PATCH /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/accounts/{number}`

**Edit or deactivate an account in the chart of accounts.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:low · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Sparse update of one kontoplan account: name, description, VAT defaults (code, booking rate, treatment), momsruta override (vat_box), SRU code and is_active (false deactivates it: history and balances stay, new verifikat cannot use it). An empty string or null clears a text field. The number, class, type and normal balance are fixed: an account that should be something else is a new account. A treatment without a rate derives the booking rate only when none is stored. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** An account needs a clearer name, other VAT defaults or SRU mapping, or should stop (or start again) being offered for bookings.
**Do not use for:** Removing an unused account (DELETE) or deactivating many at once (POST /accounts/deactivate).

**Pitfalls:**
- The path takes the account number as a STRING, e.g. /accounts/5410.
- At least one field must be sent: an empty body returns 400 ACCOUNT_NOTHING_TO_UPDATE.
- default_vat_treatment must fit the class (400 ACCOUNT_VAT_TREATMENT_CLASS); null restores the BAS mapping.
- vat_box only fits 26xx VAT accounts other than 2650; null restores the BAS momsruta.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `number` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `DELETE /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/accounts/{number}`

**Delete an account nothing has been booked on.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:medium · idempotent · dry-run`

Removes an account from the kontoplan. Refused for system accounts and for any account with journal lines in this company, on any entry status including drafts (BFL: a verifikat is immutable and its lines must keep resolving to an account). Deactivate those with PATCH is_active=false instead. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** An account was added by mistake, or an imported chart carries accounts the company never used.
**Do not use for:** Retiring an account that has been used: deactivate it (PATCH is_active=false).

**Pitfalls:**
- An account with any journal line returns 409 ACCOUNT_IN_USE with details.usage_count.
- System accounts (seeded at company creation) return 400 ACCOUNT_SYSTEM_DELETE.
- A standard BAS account can be re-added later with POST /accounts or POST /accounts/activate.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `number` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/accounts/activate`

**Activate BAS accounts in bulk.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:low · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Makes each listed account bookable: a standard BAS 2026 number missing from the chart is added from the catalogue, a deactivated account is reactivated, an active one is skipped. Numbers that are neither in the chart nor in BAS 2026 are reported in `unknown`, not refused: add those one at a time with POST /accounts. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** A booking failed with ACCOUNTS_NOT_IN_CHART, or you want a set of standard BAS accounts available before importing or booking.
**Do not use for:** A company-specific account outside BAS 2026 (POST /accounts with name, type and normal balance).

**Pitfalls:**
- account_numbers are STRINGS: ["5410", "6570"].
- Up to 2000 numbers per call; duplicates are counted once.
- Check `unknown` in the answer: those numbers were not added.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/accounts/deactivate`

**Deactivate accounts in bulk.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:low · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Deactivates each listed account so it stops being offered for new bookings; history and balances stay. System accounts are always skipped, and accounts with journal lines are skipped unless include_used=true (deactivating a used account hides its balance from the kontoplan). Already inactive numbers are counted, numbers not in the chart reported in `unknown`. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** Tidying a chart imported from a previous system, where hundreds of accounts were never posted to.
**Do not use for:** Removing accounts for good (DELETE /accounts/{number}, unused accounts only).

**Pitfalls:**
- account_numbers are STRINGS.
- include_used defaults to false: used accounts come back in skipped_used.
- Reactivate with POST /accounts/activate or PATCH is_active=true.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/compliance/check`

**Run a structured compliance pre-flight check.**
`scope:compliance:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Generalised pre-flight that consolidates the Accounted pre-close validators under one envelope. Supported check types: year_end_readiness (BFNAR 2017:3 + ÅRL 2:1 blockers), voucher_gaps (BFNAR 2013:2 kap 8 § series continuity). vat_close is planned for a follow-up PR (the underlying function currently lives in the MCP extension and core routes cannot import from extensions; it will be extracted into lib/reports/ then exposed here). New types can be added without changing the response shape.

**Use when:** Before committing to an irreversible action (VAT close, year-end close), or as a periodic audit sweep to surface blockers before they become urgent.
**Do not use for:** Executing the underlying action: this is read-only. After a passing check, call the corresponding async endpoint (POST /fiscal-periods/{id}/year-end, etc).

**Pitfalls:**
- year_end_readiness and voucher_gaps require fiscal_period_id (UUID).
- voucher_gaps covers EVERY voucher series registered for the period (A, B, F, ...), not only series A.
- A passing check is a SNAPSHOT: the state can change between the check and the action. The same blocker logic runs again on commit.
- vat_close is documented in the plan but NOT yet supported by this endpoint: call gnubok_vat_close_check via the MCP server until the function is extracted into lib/reports/.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

### `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/dimensions`

**List dimensions (kostnadsställe/projekt) with their values.**
`scope:reports:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Returns the company's dimension registry: SIE #DIM entries keyed by sie_dim_no (1 = Kostnadsställe, 6 = Projekt; both always exist): with the registered values (#OBJEKT) nested under each dimension. Dimensions are ordered by sort_order, values by code. Line-level tags on journal entries reference these values as {"<sie_dim_no>":"<code>"} in the `dimensions` map.

**Use when:** You need the valid dimension value codes before tagging journal-entry lines with a cost centre or project, or you are rendering a dimension picker.
**Do not use for:** Filtering reports (pass the dimension filter to the report endpoints once available) or reading which lines carry a tag (read the journal entries themselves).

**Pitfalls:**
- Dimension value codes are STRINGS and case-sensitive: "P001", not 1.
- sie_dim_no is the key used in journal_entry_lines.dimensions, NOT the dimension row id.
- is_active=false values are historical (archived): do not tag new lines with them.
- resets_annually=true (dim 1) means balances reset each fiscal year; dim 6 (projekt) accumulates across years.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/dimensions`

**Create a custom dimension (e.g. Avdelning, Kund, Fordon).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:low · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Adds a dimension to the registry (SIE #DIM). Omit sie_dim_no and the next free number from 20 is used: SIE reserves 1-19 for standardized meanings (1 Kostnadsställe, 6 Projekt, 7 Anställd, ...). parent_sie_dim_no declares an #UNDERDIM hierarchy and must name an existing dimension. Add values afterwards with POST /dimensions/{id}/values. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** The company wants to follow up on something beyond kostnadsställe and projekt, and no existing dimension fits.
**Do not use for:** Adding a cost centre or project code: those are values of the system dimensions 1 and 6 (POST /dimensions/{id}/values).

**Pitfalls:**
- An explicit sie_dim_no that is taken returns 409 DIMENSION_NUMBER_TAKEN; omit it to get the next free number.
- Numbers 1-19 have standardized SIE meanings: only use one when the dimension really is that (e.g. 7 Anställd).
- resets_annually defaults to true (balances reset each fiscal year, like kostnadsställe); set false for things that accumulate, like projekt.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

Request body:
```ts
{ name: string, sie_dim_no?: number, resets_annually?: boolean, parent_sie_dim_no?: number | null }
```

Example request:

{
  "name": "Avdelning"

### `PATCH /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/dimensions/{id}`

**Rename, archive or reorder a dimension.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:low · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Sparse update of a dimension: name, is_active (false archives it, hiding it from pickers while history keeps its tags) and sort_order. The system dimensions 1 (Kostnadsställe) and 6 (Projekt) can be archived and reordered but not renamed. sie_dim_no is immutable. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** A dimension needs a clearer name, should stop being offered for new tags, or should move in the pickers.
**Do not use for:** Changing a value (use PATCH /dimensions/{id}/values/{valueId}) or removing a dimension (DELETE).

**Pitfalls:**
- Renaming a system dimension returns 400 DIMENSION_SYSTEM_RENAME.
- At least one of name, is_active, sort_order must be sent.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `DELETE /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/dimensions/{id}`

**Delete a custom dimension nobody has booked on.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:medium · idempotent · dry-run`

Removes a custom dimension and its values. Refused for the system dimensions and for any dimension whose number is tagged on a posted or reversed verifikat line (BFL 7 kap: booked history is never pulled out from under a verifikat). Archive it with PATCH is_active=false instead. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** A dimension was created by mistake and nothing has been booked on it.
**Do not use for:** Retiring a dimension that has been used: archive it (PATCH is_active=false).

**Pitfalls:**
- A dimension used on any posted line returns 409 DIMENSION_REFERENCED naming it.
- System dimensions return 400 DIMENSION_SYSTEM_DELETE.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/dimensions/{id}/values`

**Create a dimension value (kostnadsställe/projekt code).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:low · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Registers a new value (SIE #OBJEKT) under a dimension: e.g. a new project code under dimension 6. Requires Idempotency-Key (UUID). Supports ?dry_run=true to validate the code format without committing. The `:id` path segment is the dimension row id (from GET …/dimensions), not the sie_dim_no. Send is_active=false to create the value archived. start_date/end_date are only allowed on accumulating dimensions (resets_annually=false, e.g. dim 6 Projekt). Duplicate codes within the dimension return 409 DIMENSION_VALUE_DUPLICATE_CODE.

**Use when:** A voucher or invoice references a cost centre / project code that does not exist yet and the user has confirmed it should be created.
**Do not use for:** Renaming or archiving an existing value (PATCH …/dimensions/{id}/values/{valueId}). Tagging lines: pass the dimensions map on the journal-entry line instead.

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory: calls without it return 400 VALIDATION_ERROR.
- The :id segment is the dimension UUID, not the SIE dimension number.
- Codes are limited to the strict Fortnox charset (A-Ö, digits, _, +, -; max 20 chars) even though historical imported codes may be looser.
- code is immutable after creation: there is no rename in v1; create the correct code and archive the wrong one.
- start_date/end_date return 400 DIMENSION_VALUE_DATES_NOT_ALLOWED on resets_annually dimensions (dim 1 Kostnadsställe).

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |

### `PATCH /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/dimensions/{id}/values/{valueId}`

**Update a dimension value (rename, archive, set start/end date).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:low · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Sparse update of a dimension value (SIE #OBJEKT): name, is_active (false = archive), start_date, end_date. `code` is immutable: renaming a code would orphan every journal line tagged with it; create a new value and archive the old one instead. Dates are only allowed on accumulating dimensions (resets_annually=false, e.g. dim 6 Projekt): use end_date to close a finished project. Idempotent (mandatory Idempotency-Key) and dry-runnable.

**Use when:** You need to rename a project/cost-centre, mark a finished project with an end date, or archive (is_active=false) a value that should no longer be used on new lines.
**Do not use for:** Changing the code (immutable: create + archive instead). Removing an unused value entirely (use DELETE). Tagging lines (pass dimensions on the journal-entry line or invoice).

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- The :id segment is the dimension UUID and :valueId the value UUID (both from GET …/dimensions), not SIE numbers or codes.
- start_date/end_date return 400 DIMENSION_VALUE_DATES_NOT_ALLOWED on resets_annually dimensions (dim 1 Kostnadsställe).
- Archived values (is_active=false) still appear in GET …/dimensions and remain valid on historical lines; they are only blocked for NEW tags.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `valueId` | path | `string` | yes |  |

### `DELETE /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/dimensions/{id}/values/{valueId}`

**Delete an unreferenced dimension value.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:medium · idempotent`

Hard-deletes a dimension value (SIE #OBJEKT) that no journal line references. Values used on posted or reversed verifikat are retained for the BFL 7-year archive and cannot be deleted: the DB trigger blocks it and this endpoint returns 409 DIMENSION_VALUE_REFERENCED. Archive those instead (PATCH is_active=false). Requires Idempotency-Key.

**Use when:** A project/cost-centre code was created by mistake (typo, duplicate) and has never been used on any booking.
**Do not use for:** Retiring a project that has bookings: PATCH is_active=false (and optionally end_date) instead. Deleting a whole dimension (not supported).

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- 409 DIMENSION_VALUE_REFERENCED means the value is used on booked verifikat: it can never be deleted, only archived.
- Deletion is permanent: the code can be re-created afterwards, but the old row id is gone.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `valueId` | path | `string` | yes |  |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/dimensions/retag`

**Change the dimension tags (kostnadsställe, projekt) on posted journal lines.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:medium · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Sets dimension tags on lines of posted verifikat, the one thing about a posted line that may change: amounts, accounts and texts never do. mode merge (default) sets the pairs in `dimensions` and keeps every other dimension the line carries; replace makes the line's tags exactly `dimensions`. Each line is its own transaction through the audited retag path, which writes an immutable before/after row with the reason (GET /dimensions/retag-log) and refuses a line in a closed or locked period, on or before the bookkeeping lock date, on a draft, or with a code that is not an active registry value. Partial success is success: refused lines are listed in failed. Idempotent. Dry-runnable: the dry run shows each line's tags before and after.

**Use when:** Posted lines lack a project or cost centre, or carry the wrong one, and you know the line ids (lines[].id of GET /journal-entries/{id}).
**Do not use for:** Changing amounts, accounts or dates (a rättelse: POST /journal-entries/{id}/correct), tagging lines of a draft (edit the draft), or clearing every tag of a line (the dashboard only).

**Pitfalls:**
- Codes are STRINGS keyed by sie_dim_no: {"6": "P001"}, and each must be an active value in the registry (GET /dimensions).
- merge keeps the line's other tags, and those must still be active registry values too: a line carrying an archived code is refused until the code is reactivated or replace is used.
- At most 500 line ids per call; the reason (3-500 characters) is stored per line.
- When every line is refused the call answers 400 DIMENSION_RETAG_FAILED with details.failed; otherwise it answers 200 with the refused lines in failed.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

`scope:reports:read · risk:low · idempotent`

The immutable trail behind every retag of a posted line: the tags before and after, who made the change, when and why. Filter by journal_entry_id and/or line_id, or read the whole company's history. The log outlives its lines (an undone SIE import deletes the verifikat, not the history). Paged with limit and offset: total_count, has_more and next_offset say what is left.

**Use when:** Explaining why a line carries its project or cost centre, or auditing who changed dimension tags on booked history.
**Do not use for:** Rättelser of amounts, accounts or texts (GET /journal-entries/{id}/rattelse-log) or the company-wide change history (GET /audit-trail).

**Pitfalls:**
- An id of another company matches nothing: the answer is an empty page, not a 404.
- Tags set when the line was booked are not here: only later changes are.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `journal_entry_id` | query | `string` | no | Only changes to lines of this verifikat. |
| `line_id` | query | `string` | no | Only changes to this line. |
| `limit` | query | `number` | no | Page size, 1-200 (default 50). |
| `offset` | query | `number` | no | Rows to skip (next_offset of the previous page). |

### `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/dimensions/rules`

**List the account dimension rules (required, default or fixed dimension per account).**
`scope:reports:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Returns the company's per-account dimension policy, by account number: required (the account cannot be posted without a value for the dimension; the booking answers MANDATORY_DIMENSION_MISSING), default (the value is filled in on a line that has none) and fixed (the value always applies, over what the line says). Paused rules (is_active false) are listed too; they are not enforced.

**Use when:** A booking was refused with MANDATORY_DIMENSION_MISSING, or before posting to an account, to know which dimensions its lines need.
**Do not use for:** The dimensions and their values themselves (GET /dimensions).

**Pitfalls:**
- account_number filters on one exact account: a STRING of 4 digits, "4010".
- A company without rules gets an empty list: dimensions are then never required.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `account_number` | query | `string` | no | Only the rules of this account. |

Response `200`:
```ts
{
  data: {
    rules: { account_dimension_rule_id: string, account_number: string, dimension_id: string, sie_dim_no: number, dimension_name: string, rule_type: "required" | "default" | "fixed", value_id: string | null, value_code: string | null, value_name: string | null, is_active: boolean }[]

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/dimensions/rules`

**Require, pre-fill or pin a dimension value on an account.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:low · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Adds a rule for one account and one dimension. required: posting the account without a value for the dimension is refused (MANDATORY_DIMENSION_MISSING), drafts may still be incomplete. default: value_id is filled in on a line of the account that carries no value for the dimension. fixed: value_id always applies, over what the line says. Takes effect for bookings from now on; posted verifikat are never changed. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** Every booking on an account should carry a project or cost centre, or an account always belongs to the same one.
**Do not use for:** Tagging lines that are already posted: a rule only acts on bookings made after it.

**Pitfalls:**
- required takes no value_id; default and fixed must name one (400 VALIDATION_ERROR otherwise).
- value_id must be an active value of that same dimension: 404 DIMENSION_VALUE_NOT_FOUND or 400 DIMENSION_VALUE_ARCHIVED.
- The account must be an active account in the chart: 404 ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND.
- One rule per account and dimension: a second answers 409 DIMENSION_RULE_EXISTS; change the existing rule with PATCH instead.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

Request body:
```ts

### `PATCH /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/dimensions/rules/{id}`

**Change, pause or resume an account dimension rule.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:low · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Sparse update of a rule: rule_type, value_id and is_active (false pauses the rule without losing it). The value rule holds for the rule as it will be: switching to required needs value_id null in the same call, switching to default or fixed needs a value. The account and the dimension of a rule are fixed: delete it and create another to move it. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** A rule should apply another value, change type, or stop being enforced for a while.
**Do not use for:** Removing a rule for good (DELETE /dimensions/rules/{id}).

**Pitfalls:**
- At least one of rule_type, value_id, is_active must be sent.
- A rule of another company answers 404 DIMENSION_RULE_NOT_FOUND.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `DELETE /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/dimensions/rules/{id}`

**Delete an account dimension rule.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:low · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Removes the rule: from then on the account neither requires nor fills in that dimension. Nothing booked changes. Pausing it instead keeps the configuration (PATCH is_active=false). Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** A rule no longer applies.
**Do not use for:** A short pause (PATCH is_active=false).

**Pitfalls:**
- A rule of another company, or one already deleted, answers 404 DIMENSION_RULE_NOT_FOUND.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods`

**List fiscal periods (räkenskapsår).**
`scope:reports:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Returns every fiscal period for the company ordered by period_start DESC. is_closed=true means bokslut has been signed; locked_at non-null means writes are blocked at the DB-trigger level.

**Use when:** You need to find the active period before booking, build a year-selector UI, or audit the period-lock history.
**Do not use for:** Creating, editing, locking or closing periods: use POST /fiscal-periods, PATCH /fiscal-periods/{id}, POST /fiscal-periods/{id}/lock, /unlock, /close and /year-end.

**Pitfalls:**
- previous_period_id chains the bokslut continuity (BFNAR 2013:2). A null value on a non-first period is a data-quality red flag.
- A period can be locked but not closed (löpande bokföring of the new year while bokslut work continues on the prior year: see BFL 5 kap 2 § for the löpande bokföring deadline).
- BFL 3 kap caps a single fiscal period at 18 months. First-year exceptions are allowed.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |

Response `200`:
```ts
{
  data: {
    fiscal_periods: { id: string, name: string, period_start: string, period_end: string, is_closed: boolean, closed_at: string | null, locked_at: string | null, previous_period_id: string | null, created_at: string, duration_days: number, exceeds_18_months: boolean }[]

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods`

**Create a fiscal year (räkenskapsår).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:medium · idempotent · dry-run`

Creates a räkenskapsår and links it into the continuity chain (previous_period_id, BFNAR 2013:2). The year must be at most 18 months, end on a month end, and start on the 1st unless it becomes the earliest year (BFL 3 kap. 1 and 3 §§). It must be contiguous with its neighbours: appended, it starts the day after the latest year ends; filling a gap, it also ends the day before the next year starts; prepended, it ends the day before the earliest year starts. A still-open prior year does not block: the 201 carries a PRIOR_FISCAL_YEAR_STILL_OPEN warning. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** The company needs the next räkenskapsår to book in (e.g. January arrives), or an earlier year must exist before its SIE file or opening balances can be imported.
**Do not use for:** Closing the prior year (run the year-end), or changing an existing year (PATCH /fiscal-periods/{id}).

**Pitfalls:**
- A start that does not continue the preceding year answers 400 FISCAL_PERIOD_NOT_CONTIGUOUS with details.expected_start (or details.expected_end): retry with that date.
- Overlapping an existing year answers 409 FISCAL_PERIOD_OVERLAP.
- An enskild firma normally runs the calendar year; a brutet räkenskapsår needs Skatteverket's permission.
- There is no delete: a wrong year can be re-dated with PATCH only while nothing is posted in it.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `PATCH /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}`

**Rename or re-date an open fiscal year.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:medium · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Sparse update of an open, unlocked räkenskapsår: name, period_start, period_end. The name can change at any time on an open year; the dates only while no posted or reversed verifikat exist in it. New dates follow the same BFL 3 kap. rules as create (18-month cap, month-end end, 1st-of-month start unless it is the earliest year, calendar year for an enskild firma) and may not overlap another year. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** A year was created with the wrong dates or name and nothing has been booked in it yet.
**Do not use for:** Moving verifikat between years, changing a locked or closed year, or lengthening a year that already has bookings.

**Pitfalls:**
- Any posted or reversed verifikat in the year answers 409 FISCAL_PERIOD_HAS_POSTED_ENTRIES when dates are sent: send only name to rename.
- A locked year answers 409 FISCAL_PERIOD_UPDATE_LOCKED, a closed one 409 FISCAL_PERIOD_UPDATE_CLOSED.
- Re-dating does not re-chain previous_period_id: keep the years contiguous yourself.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `PATCH /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/arsredovisning/compliance`

**Answer the årsredovisning compliance questions and record the confirmations.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:medium · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Sparse update of the compliance profile the ÅRL, K2 and K3 checks read: publikt bolag, likvidation, listed securities, moderföretag and group size, foreign branch, crypto, share-based payments, convertibles, building revenue share, deferred tax, reporting currency, revisionsberättelse, dividend prudence. narrative_confirmed, k2_assessment_confirmed and signer_roster_confirmed record (true) or withdraw (false) the user's confirmations with a timestamp. Answers the recomputed eligibility, validation and capabilities. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** The validation (gnubok_validate_arsredovisning) reports an unanswered compliance question or a missing confirmation.
**Do not use for:** The document texts (POST .../arsredovisning/narrative) or the signer roster itself (POST .../arsredovisning/signatures).

**Pitfalls:**
- An unanswered question is null, never false: false is a legal assertion that the condition does not apply.
- signer_roster_confirmed asserts the roster matches the board and VD registered at Bolagsverket; any later roster change clears it.
- is_parent_company false also clears parent_group_size and prepares_consolidated_accounts.
- Send at least one field (400 VALIDATION_ERROR otherwise).

| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/arsredovisning/ixbrl`

**The K2 årsredovisning as an inline XBRL (XHTML) document.**
`scope:reports:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Generates the iXBRL document Bolagsverket's digital filing takes (K2, Bolagsverket taxonomy), for the live draft or a frozen version (version_id). The XHTML is also the human-readable document. It is not a filing: digital filing goes through connected software with the fastställelseintyg signed by BankID, which this API does not do.

**Use when:** Archiving the digital document, or validating it with external tools.
**Do not use for:** The pre-flight result as JSON (GET .../arsredovisning/ixbrl/validate) or a printable copy (GET .../arsredovisning/pdf).

**Pitfalls:**
- K2 aktiebolag only.
- The live draft is refused while an SIE import is unfinished (409); a frozen version stays readable.
- proposed_dividend (whole SEK) applies to the live draft only.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `version_id` | query | `string` | no | A frozen version (annual_report_version_id); omit for the live draft. |
| `proposed_dividend` | query | `number` | no | Live draft only: proposed dividend in whole SEK for the resultatdisposition. |

Response `200` (`application/xhtml+xml`).

### `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/arsredovisning/ixbrl/validate`

**Pre-flight the generated iXBRL årsredovisning against Bolagsverket's kontrollera rules.**
`scope:reports:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Generates the K2 inline XBRL document (the live draft, or a frozen version with version_id) and runs the local mirror of Bolagsverket's kontrollera checks on it, plus a generation dry run and the 5 MB size limit. Issues carry the Bolagsverket code where one exists (e.g. 1107 missing signers) or ACC-*. Nothing is sent to Bolagsverket. Read-only.

**Use when:** Before a digital filing, or to see why the iXBRL document is not ready.
**Do not use for:** The ÅRL/K2 completeness checks per stage (gnubok_validate_arsredovisning), or the document itself (GET .../arsredovisning/ixbrl, v1 only).

**Pitfalls:**
- K2 aktiebolag only: the iXBRL generator does not produce K3 documents.
- A validation with issues still answers 200; read ok and error_count.
- An unknown version_id answers 404 NOT_FOUND.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `version_id` | query | `string` | no | A frozen version (annual_report_version_id); omit for the live draft. |
| `proposed_dividend` | query | `number` | no | Live draft only: proposed dividend in whole SEK for the resultatdisposition. |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/arsredovisning/narrative`

**Edit the årsredovisning texts: förvaltningsberättelse, resultatdisposition, disclosure notes and K3 note texts.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:medium · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Saves the narrative overrides for a räkenskapsår's årsredovisning, as the dashboard's text step does. Only the fields sent change; null clears a field back to the generated text. Covers the förvaltningsberättelse (description, important_events), the resultatdisposition text and proposed_dividend, the årsstämma date and decision, the ÅRL 5 kap. disclosures (long-term debt, ställda säkerheter, eventualförpliktelser), koncernförhållanden, a manual medelantal anställda, K3 note texts (note_overrides replaces the whole object) and the K3 kassaflödesanalys omission. A save clears the narrative confirmation in the compliance profile. Allowed after the period is closed; refused once a Bolagsverket submission is registrerad. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** Writing or correcting the texts of the årsredovisning before a version is frozen for signing.
**Do not use for:** The compliance profile answers (PATCH .../arsredovisning/compliance), the figures (they come from the books), or freezing the document (POST .../arsredovisning/versions).

**Pitfalls:**
- A version already frozen keeps its text: freeze a new version after editing.
- agm_disposition_outcome alternative_decision needs agm_disposition_decision text (400 VALIDATION_ERROR).
- parent_company_org_number is an organisationsnummer or a foreign registration id; a personnummer is refused.
- Registered at Bolagsverket: 409 ARSREDOVISNING_REGISTERED.
- Saving clears narrative_confirmed: confirm again with PATCH .../compliance {"narrative_confirmed": true}.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/arsredovisning/pdf`

**The årsredovisning as PDF: the live draft or a frozen version.**
`scope:reports:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Renders the årsredovisning for the räkenskapsår (K2 or K3 template by the framework) as the dashboard does. Without version_id it is the live draft from the books, named ...-utkast.pdf; with version_id it is that immutable version with the signatures recorded on it, named ...-papperskopia.pdf once signed. Nothing is sent to Bolagsverket.

**Use when:** A printable copy for the board to sign on paper, the archive, or a review.
**Do not use for:** The inline XBRL document for digital filing (GET .../arsredovisning/ixbrl) or the report as JSON (gnubok_preview_arsredovisning).

**Pitfalls:**
- The live draft is refused while an SIE import is unfinished (409); a frozen version stays readable.
- An unknown version_id answers 404 NOT_FOUND.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `version_id` | query | `string` | no | A frozen version (annual_report_version_id); omit for the live draft. |

Response `200` (`application/pdf`).

### `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/arsredovisning/signatures`

**The årsredovisning signer roster and its signatures.**
`scope:reports:read · risk:low · idempotent`

The current signer slots for the räkenskapsår: the unbound pending roster while one exists, otherwise the slots bound to the latest version with their status, signing date, method and evidence reference. The signature_id values are what PATCH and DELETE .../signatures/{signatureId} take; finalizing a version may create new slots bound to it. Read-only.

**Use when:** Before adding a signer (avoid duplicates) or to find the slot to record a signature on after a version is finalized.
**Do not use for:** The report content (gnubok_preview_arsredovisning) or the version list (gnubok_list_arsredovisning_versions).

**Pitfalls:**
- Declined slots are listed too; they do not appear in the document.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |

Response `200`:

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/arsredovisning/signatures`

**Add a board member or the VD to the årsredovisning signer roster.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:medium · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Adds a pending signer slot (role and name) to the roster for the räkenskapsår. ÅRL 2 kap. 7 § requires every ordinarie styrelseledamot and the VD, if any, to sign. This records who is to sign; it signs nothing and involves no BankID. Any roster change clears the signer roster confirmation. Answers 201 with the slot. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** Setting up who signs, before finalizing a version (POST .../arsredovisning/versions action finalize).
**Do not use for:** Recording that someone signed (PATCH .../signatures/{signatureId}) or filing with Bolagsverket.

**Pitfalls:**
- The same role and name twice on the unbound roster answers 409 ARSREDOVISNING_SIGNER_ALREADY_EXISTS.
- signer_name is the name as registered at Bolagsverket; a personnummer is refused (400).
- Confirm the roster afterwards: PATCH .../compliance {"signer_roster_confirmed": true}.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |

### `PATCH /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/arsredovisning/signatures/{signatureId}`

**Record that a signer signed the frozen årsredovisning version, or declined.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:medium · idempotent · dry-run`

status signed records the evidence of a signature made outside the product (a paper original or an advanced e-signature): the ready_for_signature version it is for, the method, where the original is kept (evidence_reference) and the signing time. status declined marks the slot declined. Only a pending slot of this period transitions, once. ÅRL requires each signer to date their signature; the date must fall between the version's finalization and today. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** The board has signed the printed or e-signed document and the signatures are to be registered.
**Do not use for:** Adding signers (POST .../signatures), filing with Bolagsverket, or BankID signing (not available here).

**Pitfalls:**
- A version that is not ready_for_signature answers 409 ARSREDOVISNING_VERSION_NOT_SIGNABLE.
- A slot already signed or declined, bound to another version, or of another period answers 409 SIGNATURE_INVALID_TRANSITION.
- A signed_at before finalization or in the future answers 400 ARSREDOVISNING_SIGNATURE_DATE_INVALID.
- evidence_reference is archive:<ref>, document:<id> or receipt:<ref>, not free text.
- Recorded signatures cannot be undone: finalize a new version instead.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `signatureId` | path | `string` | yes |  |

### `DELETE /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/arsredovisning/signatures/{signatureId}`

**Remove a signer from the årsredovisning roster before a version binds it.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:low · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Deletes a pending signer slot that no version has bound yet. Slots bound to a finalized version stay (they are part of what gets signed): finalize a new version with the corrected roster instead. Any roster change clears the signer roster confirmation. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** A signer was added by mistake or has left the board before the version is finalized.
**Do not use for:** Declining a bound slot (PATCH .../signatures/{signatureId} {"status": "declined"}).

**Pitfalls:**
- A bound, signed or declined slot answers 409 ARSREDOVISNING_SIGNER_ROSTER_LOCKED.
- Takes no body.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/arsredovisning/versions`

**Freeze an immutable årsredovisning version: a draft snapshot, or the version that gets signed.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent · dry-run`

Builds the årsredovisning from a complete read of the books (refused while an SIE import is unfinished) and stores it as an immutable version with its content hash. action snapshot stores a draft; action finalize requires every signing-stage check to pass, marks the version ready_for_signature, supersedes an earlier ready or signed version and binds the signer roster to it. certificate_signer names who signs the fastställelseintyg. expected_content_hash (from a dry run) makes the call refuse when the content has changed since. Answers 201 with the version. Idempotent. Dry-runnable: the dry run answers the content hash and the validation counts.

**Use when:** The texts, compliance answers and signer roster are done and the document is to be signed (finalize), or a checkpoint of the draft is wanted (snapshot).
**Do not use for:** Filing with Bolagsverket (dashboard only, BankID), recording signatures (PATCH .../signatures/{signatureId}) or reading the document (GET .../arsredovisning/pdf).

**Pitfalls:**
- Statements that do not tie, or (finalize) any signing-stage error, answer 409 ARSREDOVISNING_INCOMPLETE with the validation in details: run gnubok_validate_arsredovisning with stage signing first.
- finalize needs a confirmed signer roster (PATCH .../compliance {"signer_roster_confirmed": true}) and at least one signer.
- Content changed since the hash you pass: 409 ARSREDOVISNING_CONTENT_CHANGED; dry-run again and review.
- A new finalize supersedes the previous ready_for_signature version; signatures recorded on it do not carry over.
- Refused while an SIE import is unfinished: complete or undo it first.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/close`

**Close a fiscal period (IRREVERSIBLE per BFL 5 kap 8 §).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent`

Sets is_closed=true + closed_at on the period. Pre-requisites: period must be locked (call /lock first) AND year-end closing must have been executed (call /year-end first). Sync. The DB blocks any subsequent JE inserts.

**Use when:** Final step in the year-end flow: lock → year-end → close. Closing freezes the period for BFL 7 kap retention.
**Do not use for:** Locking a period (use /lock). Running the year-end closing entry (use /year-end). UNDOING a close (not supported, irreversible).

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- IRREVERSIBLE. Once is_closed=true, the period is read-only forever (BFL 5 kap 8 § + 7 kap).
- Pre-conditions: locked + closing_entry_id present. Otherwise the call returns CONFLICT.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/close-external`

**Mark a migrated fiscal year as closed in the previous system (klarmarkera).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Closes and locks an imported historical räkenskapsår whose bokslut was done in the previous bookkeeping software, without a closing entry here, and writes the decision to the audit log. Only for migrated years: the year must have ended, have no closing entry in Accounted, and hold imported verifikat, no verifikat, or balance-sheet-only verifikat with the next year's IB already posted. Unbooked bank transactions in the year block it, as for a lock. Undo with reopen-external. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** After an SIE migration, the earlier years show as pending bokslut although their bokslut was done in the old system.
**Do not use for:** Closing a year bookkept in Accounted: run the year-end (POST /fiscal-periods/{id}/year-end), which transfers the result and carries the balances forward.

**Pitfalls:**
- A year bookkept here with result accounts answers 409 FISCAL_PERIOD_CLOSE_EXTERNAL_NATIVE_BOOKKEEPING: run the year-end instead.
- A running year answers 409 FISCAL_PERIOD_CLOSE_EXTERNAL_NOT_ENDED.
- Unbooked bank transactions answer 400 PERIOD_HAS_UNBOOKED_TRANSACTIONS with the count in details.reason.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/currency-revaluation`

**Run FX revaluation for the fiscal period.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent · reversible`

Re-rates open foreign-currency AR (1510) and AP (2440) at the closing date's Riksbanken rate and posts the SEK delta to 3960 (valutakursvinst) / 7960 (valutakursförlust). Returns 202 with operation_id. Idempotent per-period: the engine throws if a revaluation has already been posted for the same fiscal_period_id.

**Use when:** Before /year-end if your books have open foreign-currency receivables or payables. /year-end also runs this internally, so you only need to call it separately when you want the FX-only entry without the full closing.
**Do not use for:** Re-running on the same period (CURRENCY_REVALUATION_ALREADY_EXISTS). Revaluing a closed period (the trigger blocks JE writes to closed periods).

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- Engine returns null if no open foreign-currency items exist: the operation succeeds with result.revaluation_entry_id=null.
- as_of_date defaults to period_end if omitted.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |

Request body:

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/lock`

**Lock a fiscal period (no new entries can be posted into it).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent · reversible`

Sets locked_at on the period. Refuses if uncategorised business transactions remain in the period: they must be bokfört first. The DB trigger blocks JE inserts into locked periods; locking is the application-level pre-step before /close. Sync.

**Use when:** Finishing a period and you want to stop new postings. Step 1 of a three-step year-end flow: lock → year-end → close.
**Do not use for:** Locking an already-closed period (no-op). Bypassing the uncategorised-transactions guard: categorise or mark-private first.

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- A period with uncategorised business transactions cannot be locked; the response surfaces the count.
- Locking is reversible until /close: POST /fiscal-periods/{id}/unlock lifts it.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |

Response `200`:

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/opening-balances`

**Generate opening-balance verifikation for the next fiscal period.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent · reversible`

Reads the closed period's trial balance, filters to BAS class 1-2 accounts with non-zero closing balance, and posts an opening verifikation (status=posted) onto the next_period_id. Sync. The path id is the CLOSED period; body.next_period_id is the target.

**Use when:** After /year-end + /close on a period, generate the IB into the next period so the new year starts with the correct balance sheet.
**Do not use for:** Posting opening balances on a manually-edited basis (use POST /journal-entries with source_type=manual). Re-running on the same target period (will produce duplicate IB entries).

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- next_period_id must reference the SAME company and must NOT already have an IB entry. The engine throws if it does.
- Only class 1 (assets) and 2 (equity/liabilities) flow into the IB; class 3-8 are zeroed by the closing entry.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/opening-balances/correct`

**Correct a year's ingående balanser by storno: the full corrected IB replaces the old one.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent · dry-run`

Books the corrected IB verifikat from the lines given (the complete IB, not a difference), stornoes the old IB verifikat and relinks the year to the new one (BFL 5 kap 5 §: nothing posted is edited). The new verifikat's text references the one it corrects. With cascade=true the per-account change is also carried into every later year's IB; years that are closed, locked, behind the lock date or have a bokslut are skipped and reported. Only for an open, unlocked year with an IB and no bokslut. Idempotent. Dry-runnable: the dry run previews the new verifikat and the per-account change and writes nothing.

**Use when:** The IB booked for a year was wrong (a typo, a balance the previous system corrected later).
**Do not use for:** A year without an IB (POST /fiscal-periods/{id}/opening-balances/manual), a single wrong line in an open year (POST /journal-entries/{id}/strike-lines on the IB verifikat corrects inside the same verifikat), or a year that is locked, closed or has a bokslut (unwind those first).

**Pitfalls:**
- Send the COMPLETE corrected IB: accounts left out end at zero.
- A year without an IB answers 409 OB_CORRECT_NO_EXISTING; one with a posted bokslut 409 OB_CORRECT_YEAR_END_EXISTS.
- A company lock date on or after the year's start answers 409 OB_COMPANY_LOCK_DATE.
- If the storno or relink fails the new IB is stornoed again and 500 OB_CORRECT_FAILED names both entry ids: the year keeps its old IB.
- cascade is best effort per later year: read cascade.skipped in the response and correct those years by hand.

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/opening-balances/manual`

**Book a fiscal year's ingående balanser (IB) from explicit lines, for a company new to Accounted.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent · dry-run`

Posts the IB verifikat (source_type opening_balance, series A, dated the year's first day) through the bookkeeping engine and links it to the year, as the dashboard's opening balance import does. Lines are balance sheet accounts only (class 1-2), zero rows dropped, at least two left, debit equal to credit. BAS accounts missing from the chart are activated. Refused when the year already has an IB, is closed or locked, or starts on or before the company lock date. Idempotent. Dry-runnable: the dry run previews the verifikat and writes nothing.

**Use when:** The company moved from another system without an SIE file and its first year in Accounted needs the balances from the previous system's balansräkning.
**Do not use for:** Carrying the IB forward from a year closed in Accounted (POST /fiscal-periods/{id}/opening-balances, or the year-end which does it), an SIE migration (POST /imports/sie brings its own IB), or changing an IB already booked (POST /fiscal-periods/{id}/opening-balances/correct).

**Pitfalls:**
- A year that already has an IB answers 409 OB_PERIOD_ALREADY_HAS_BALANCES with details.existingEntryId: correct it instead.
- Class 3-8 accounts answer 400 OB_PNL_ACCOUNT, class 0 and 9 400 OB_NON_BALANCE_SHEET_ACCOUNT: an IB holds balance sheet accounts only, earlier years' results sit in equity (20xx).
- Debit and credit must match to the öre: 400 OB_UNBALANCED with details.diff.
- A company lock date on or after the year's start answers 409 OB_SET_COMPANY_LOCK_DATE; a closed or locked year 400 OB_PERIOD_CLOSED or OB_PERIOD_LOCKED.
- The IB is a posted verifikat: it is never edited or deleted, only corrected by storno through /opening-balances/correct.

### `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/opening-balances/split-per-project`

**Preview splitting a year's ingående balanser per project from the previous year's tagged closing balances.**
`scope:reports:read · risk:low · idempotent`

For the year's IB verifikat, computes the per-project split of each balance sheet account from the previous fiscal year's closing balances per object of the dimensions that carry across years (registry resets_annually = false: projekt, dimension 6). Each such account becomes one line per project plus one untagged remainder (the current IB minus the projects, any sign); the account total never changes. Accounts without a project balance last year, and the VAT accounts (26xx), stay untouched. Answers current and proposed lines per account, which accounts change, unresolved project codes, and blocked (code and Swedish message) when the year is closed, locked, behind the lock date or has a bokslut. Read-only.

**Use when:** A project-filtered ledger opens at zero for a year whose IB was booked before project balances were carried (an IB imported or closed earlier), and the user asks how project balances carry into the new year.
**Do not use for:** Changing amounts in the IB (POST /fiscal-periods/{id}/opening-balances/correct) or a year closed after project balances were carried: the year-end already splits the IB per project.

**Pitfalls:**
- The basis is the previous year in Accounted as it stands: if that year is still open (source_period_closed false), later bookings there change the split.
- A previous year whose own IB was untagged only carries the projects' movements of that year.
- An account whose IB already carries a different project split (an IB imported with SIE #OIB, or split by hand) is skipped with skip_reason existing_split, never overwritten.
- unresolved_dimensions lists codes missing from the registry: the apply refuses until they exist.

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/opening-balances/split-per-project`

**Split a year's ingående balanser per project, inside the same IB verifikat (inline rättelse).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent · dry-run`

Applies the split GET /fiscal-periods/{id}/opening-balances/split-per-project previews: for each changing account the IB verifikat's lines are struck and replaced by one line per project plus an untagged remainder, inside the same verifikat through the inline rättelse (BFL 5 kap 5 §; the struck lines are kept in the rättelse log with who and when). Account totals never change. Every project code is checked against the dimension registry first; archived projects are kept. Only for an open, unlocked year after the lock date and without a bokslut; there is no storno fallback, because a storno-corrected IB carries no project tags. A split already in place answers applied=false and writes nothing. Idempotent. Dry-runnable: the dry run answers the preview.

**Use when:** The user wants project balances carried into a year whose IB was booked as one line per account, after reviewing the preview.
**Do not use for:** Changing IB amounts (POST /fiscal-periods/{id}/opening-balances/correct), or a locked or closed year: open it first.

**Pitfalls:**
- Pass expected_fingerprint from the preview: if the IB or the previous year changed since, 409 OB_SPLIT_PROPOSAL_CHANGED instead of a different split.
- A closed year answers 409 OB_SPLIT_PERIOD_CLOSED, a locked one 409 OB_SPLIT_PERIOD_LOCKED, a lock date covering the IB 409 OB_COMPANY_LOCK_DATE, a posted bokslut 409 OB_CORRECT_YEAR_END_EXISTS.
- Project codes missing from the registry answer 409 OB_SPLIT_DIMENSION_UNRESOLVED with details.unresolved.
- An account with a foreign-currency IB line or a line-level underlag link, or whose IB already carries a different project split, is skipped (accounts_skipped), never forced.
- With nothing to change the apply answers 200 applied=false, but a dry run (and MCP staging) answers 409 OB_SPLIT_NOTHING_TO_DO: there is nothing to approve.
- Over 100 new lines run as several inline rättelser. A failure after one committed answers the error with details.accounts_changed and details.rattelse_log_ids; the books stay consistent and a rerun continues from there.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/reopen-external`

**Undo klarmarkera: reopen a year marked closed in the previous system.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Reopens and unlocks a räkenskapsår that close-external closed, and writes the decision to the audit log. Only while that close is still the klarmarkera one: a year closed by a year-end run in Accounted is never reopened. Typical need: the prior-year SIE file was wrong and must be replaced. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** A year was marked closed in the previous system by mistake, or its imported contents must be replaced.
**Do not use for:** Reopening a year closed by a year-end here (not possible), or unlocking a locked year (POST /fiscal-periods/{id}/unlock).

**Pitfalls:**
- An open year answers 409 PERIOD_REOPEN_NOT_CLOSED.
- A year closed by a year-end run here answers 409 PERIOD_REOPEN_NOT_EXTERNAL.
- The lock is cleared too: lock or klarmarkera the year again once the correction is done.

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/unlock`

**Unlock a locked (not closed) fiscal year.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Clears locked_at so the year accepts postings again, and writes the unlock to the audit log (BFNAR 2013:2 behandlingshistorik). A closed year is never unlocked: past a close, corrections go into an open year as storno. Re-lock with POST /fiscal-periods/{id}/lock after the correction. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** The user asked to correct something in a locked year, or a year-end must run on a year that was locked beforehand.
**Do not use for:** Getting a booking past a lock without the user asking for that correction, or reopening a closed year (a year marked closed in a previous system: POST /fiscal-periods/{id}/reopen-external).

**Pitfalls:**
- A closed year answers 409 PERIOD_UNLOCK_CLOSED; an unlocked one 409 PERIOD_UNLOCK_NOT_LOCKED.
- The company-wide lock date (bookkeeping_locked_through) is a separate lock this does not touch.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/fiscal-periods/{id}/year-end`

**Execute year-end closing (currency revaluation + closing entry).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent`

Async-operation endpoint. Runs the year-end closing flow: currency revaluation (FX gains/losses to 3960/7960), then posts the closing entry that zeroes class 3-8 onto årets resultat (2099 for AB, the relevant eget-kapital account in the 2010-2019 range for enskild firma: the engine resolves which based on company.entity_type). Returns 202 with operation_id; subscribe to operation.completed or poll /v1/operations/{id}.

**Use when:** After /lock and a passing /compliance/check?type=year_end_readiness, you want to run the closing entry. This is step 2 of the lock → year-end → close flow.
**Do not use for:** Re-running year-end (per-period idempotent: fails if closing_entry_id is already set). Closing the period (use /close after year-end succeeds).

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- Period must pass year_end_readiness checks (no drafts, no unexplained voucher gaps, trial balance balanced). The engine re-validates and aborts if not.
- Closing entry is itself a verifikation (posted): the period must NOT already be closed.

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/skattekonto/sync`

**Fetch the skattekonto from Skatteverket now instead of waiting for the hourly sync.**
`scope:transactions:write · risk:low · idempotent · dry-run`

Reads the company's skattekonto saldo and transactions (booked and upcoming) from Skatteverket and stores them, then refreshes the booking proposals and the reconciliation snapshot. Books nothing: booking skattekonto rows is a separate step. Read-only on Skatteverket's side. Runs on the company's connection (any member's BankID connection, or a verified läsombud grant). Idempotent. Dry-runnable: the dry run checks the connection locally and never calls Skatteverket.

**Use when:** A payment to or from the skattekonto was just made and the reconciliation or the booking proposals should see it now.
**Do not use for:** Booking skattekonto rows, or importing a skattekonto file (POST /imports/skattekonto-file).

**Pitfalls:**
- Needs a live Skatteverket connection: 401 SKATTEVERKET_NOT_CONNECTED when the company has none or it expired (personal BankID sessions last about 1 hour by design). Only a person can reconnect; do not retry until they confirm.
- The paid Skatteverket capability is required: 403 SKATTEVERKET_CAPABILITY_BLOCKED otherwise.
- Skatteverket only returns roughly the last 555 days; older history comes from a skattekonto file import.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/skatteverket/agi/validate-huvuduppgift`

**Pre-validate an AGI huvuduppgift at Skatteverket without filing anything.**
`scope:compliance:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Sends one arbetsgivardeklaration huvuduppgift (AGI API v1.7 section 7: agRegistreradId, redovisningsPeriod, the totals) to Skatteverket's /kontrollera and answers its kontrollsvar: an overall status and each finding. Skatteverket saves nothing; the only local write is the regulator audit row. Uses the calling user's own Skatteverket connection. Live call, not cached.

**Use when:** Checking a hand-built or externally generated huvuduppgift before filing it, e.g. from a payroll system outside Accounted.
**Do not use for:** Filing (POST /salary-runs/{id}/generate-agi, then the BankID-signed submission) or checking a salary run booked in Accounted (the submission flow validates it).

**Pitfalls:**
- Needs a live Skatteverket connection: 401 SKATTEVERKET_NOT_CONNECTED when the company has none or it expired (personal BankID sessions last about 1 hour by design). Only a person can reconnect; do not retry until they confirm.
- redovisningsPeriod is YYYYMM and no earlier than 201807; amounts are whole kronor.
- A payload that breaks the v1.7 schema answers 400 VALIDATION_ERROR before anything reaches Skatteverket.
- status OK or INFO means Skatteverket would accept the figures; it never checks them against the books.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/skatteverket/agi/validate-individuppgift`

**Pre-validate one AGI individuppgift at Skatteverket without filing anything.**
`scope:compliance:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Sends one individuppgift (AGI API v1.7 section 8: the payee, specifikationsnummer, cash pay, benefits, preliminary tax and flags) to Skatteverket's /kontrollera and answers its kontrollsvar. Skatteverket saves nothing; the only local write is the regulator audit row. Uses the calling user's own Skatteverket connection. Live call, not cached.

**Use when:** Checking a hand-built or externally generated individuppgift before filing it.
**Do not use for:** Filing, or salary runs booked in Accounted (the AGI submission flow builds and validates their individuppgifter).

**Pitfalls:**
- Needs a live Skatteverket connection: 401 SKATTEVERKET_NOT_CONNECTED when the company has none or it expired (personal BankID sessions last about 1 hour by design). Only a person can reconnect; do not retry until they confirm.
- betalningsmottagarId is the payee's personnummer (12 digits): it is sent to Skatteverket and not stored by Accounted beyond the audit row's metadata.
- forstaAnstalld and vaxaStod (FK062/FK063) exist only through redovisningsPeriod 202512 and are mutually exclusive. Setting either for 202601 or later answers 400 VALIDATION_ERROR: växa-stöd is now a refund applied for after filing (Lag 2025:1334), and the individuppgift carries the full avgifter.
- A payload that breaks the v1.7 schema answers 400 VALIDATION_ERROR before anything reaches Skatteverket.

### `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/skatteverket/vat-declarations`

**Read a filed momsdeklaration (submitted and/or decided) from Skatteverket.**
`scope:compliance:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Fetches the momsdeklaration for one period as Skatteverket has it on file: `submitted` is the declaration as filed (SKV /inlamnat), `decided` is Skatteverket's beslut (SKV /beslutat). Either section is null when nothing is on file for the period (or when excluded via ?state=). Query params: period_type (monthly|quarterly|yearly), year, period (1-12 monthly, 1-4 quarterly, 1 yearly), optional state (submitted|decided|both, default both). Requires the company to have an active Skatteverket connection (any member's BankID connection, or a verified ombud grant). Live read against Skatteverket, not a cached copy.

**Use when:** You want to verify what was actually filed for a VAT period, compare a period against last year's filed declaration, or check whether Skatteverket has decided a period.
**Do not use for:** Computing the declaration from the books (use the VAT report), or filing: submission is a separate BankID-signed flow.

**Pitfalls:**
- This is a live Skatteverket read: it fails with SKATTEVERKET_NOT_CONNECTED (401) when the company has neither a member's BankID connection (made under Installningar) nor a verified ombud grant, and the response reflects SKV's state, not the books. Personal BankID sessions expire after ~1 hour by design, so an expired connection is normal: ask the user to reconnect; only a person can, so do not retry until they confirm.
- submitted=null and decided=null with HTTP 200 means "nothing on file for the period": it is not an error.
- A submitted declaration can lack a beslut for days: poll decided separately rather than assuming both appear together.
- redovisningsperiod is SKV's YYYYMM format (the period's LAST month): quarterly period 1 is 03, not 01.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `period_type` | query | `"monthly" \| "quarterly" \| "yearly"` | yes |  |
| `year` | query | `number` | yes |  |
| `period` | query | `number` | yes |  |
| `state` | query | `"submitted" \| "decided" \| "both"` | no |  |
