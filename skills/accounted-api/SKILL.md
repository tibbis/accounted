  Consume the Accounted REST API (Swedish double-entry bookkeeping SaaS,
  https://app.gnubok.se/api/v1). Use when building an integration, app, backend
  job, or agent tool layer against Accounted: invoices, customers,
  suppliers, supplier invoices, journal entries (bokföring), bank
  transactions and reconciliation, payroll (lön), VAT/moms and financial
  reports, SIE import/export, documents, webhooks. Covers auth with
  gnubok_sk_ API keys, conventions (dry-run, idempotency, cursor
  pagination, scopes), and all 294 endpoints.

# Accounted API integration

Accounted is Swedish double-entry bookkeeping (bokföring) as a service: BAS
chart of accounts, verifikationer with legally immutable audit trails, VAT
(moms), payroll (lön), invoicing, bank reconciliation, and statutory reports,
exposed as a REST API designed for agents and integrations first.

**This skill is for building software against the REST API** (an app, a
backend job, an agent tool layer). If the goal is to *operate* a ledger
conversationally (book receipts, run month close), use the Accounted MCP
connector and its workflow skills instead: install the `accounted` plugin or
see https://app.gnubok.se/docs/api/connect-claude.

If you have used Stripe's API the shape will feel familiar: bearer keys, dated
versions, idempotency keys, webhook signatures, cursor pagination. The domain
rules are Swedish accounting law; the Gotchas section below stops the classic
violations before you ship them.

## Auth and base URL

Every request sends a bearer key:

```bash
curl https://app.gnubok.se/api/v1/companies \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer gnubok_sk_live_..."
```

- Base URL: `https://app.gnubok.se/api/v1` (legacy machine host, permanent).
  `https://app.accounted.se/api/v1` serves the identical API.
- Keys are created in the Accounted dashboard under **Settings -> API**
  (`/settings/api`). Two prefixes:
  - `gnubok_sk_live_*` commits real writes.
  - `gnubok_sk_test_*` reads real company data but forces every write into
    dry-run (responses carry `X-Gnubok-Mode: test`). Develop and run evals
    with a test key; switch to live last.
- Each key carries **scopes** (`invoices:read`, `invoices:write`,
  `payroll:write`, `webhooks:manage`, ...). Every endpoint in the index below
  is annotated with its required scope; a missing scope returns `403`.
- Rate limit: 100 requests/minute per key. On `429`, honor `Retry-After`.
- URLs carry the company id explicitly
  (`/api/v1/companies/{companyId}/invoices`). A key can act on any company its
  user is a member of; start every session with `GET /api/v1/companies` to
  discover ids. There is no implicit "current company".

First calls, in order: `GET /api/v1/health` (no auth, connectivity), then
`GET /api/v1/companies` (auth works, discover `companyId`).

## Conventions

These rules hold across the whole surface; endpoint entries below do not
repeat them.

**Response envelope.** Success: `{ "data": ..., "meta": { "request_id",
"api_version", "next_cursor"?, "audit"?, "partial_expansions"? } }`. Errors
replace `data` with `error` (no `meta`; `request_id` moves inside `error`).

**Errors.** Stable machine codes with agent-oriented remediation:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "PERIOD_LOCKED", "message": "Svenska", "message_en": "English",
  "details": {}, "recovery_hint": "next step", "docs_url": "...",
  "valid_alternatives": {}, "request_id": "req_..." } }
```

React to `code`, read `message_en` and `recovery_hint`, follow
`valid_alternatives` when present (e.g. `next_open_period`). Standard codes on
every endpoint: `400` validation, `401` bad key, `403` missing scope, `404`,
`429` rate limited (honor `Retry-After`), `500`. Full catalogue:
https://app.gnubok.se/docs/api/errors. Only endpoint-specific codes are
mentioned per endpoint below.

**Cursor pagination.** List endpoints take `?cursor=` and return
`meta.next_cursor`; loop until it is absent/null. A stale or tampered cursor
is NOT an error: the first page is returned again, so terminate on
`next_cursor`, never on "page looks familiar".

**Dry-run on every write that supports it** (`dry-run` badge in the index).
Send `?dry_run=true` (or `X-Dry-Run: true`): the response is always `200` with
`data.dry_run: true` plus a preview (would-be record, journal lines, voucher
number) and the `X-Dry-Run: true` response header; nothing is committed.
Commit by re-issuing without the flag and with the SAME `Idempotency-Key`
(the dry run is not cached against the key). Preview first on any financial
write; it is free.

**Idempotency-Key.** Send a fresh UUID header on every POST/PATCH/DELETE;
several endpoints reject writes without one (`400`). Replaying the same
key+body returns the original response with the `Idempotent-Replayed: true`
header; the same key with a different body returns `409 IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSE`
(24h window). Safe retry loop: keep the key, keep the body.

**Test keys are simulation-only.** With a `gnubok_sk_test_*` key, reads
return real company data (responses carry `X-Gnubok-Mode: test`) and every
write is forced into dry-run; writes that cannot be simulated return
`403 TEST_KEY_WRITE_BLOCKED`. Nothing a test key does ever persists: it is
`?dry_run=true` baked into the credential. Full end-to-end write tests
therefore need a live key against a company you own.

**Atomic writes.** A mutation either commits fully or errors with no side
effects. There is no partial state to clean up after an error response
(`bulk-create` endpoints that do partial success say so explicitly).

**Audit inline.** Successful financial writes include `meta.audit` (voucher
number, audit-trail URL, immutability timestamp). No follow-up read needed to
confirm what was booked.

**Expansion.** Some list/detail endpoints take `?expand=a,b` (documented per
endpoint). If an expansion fails the response still succeeds and names the
failed parts in `meta.partial_expansions`; check it before trusting expanded
fields.

**Report query parameters.** A report read never answers an unfiltered report
to a dimension filter it cannot apply: `dim_no`, `dim_code`, `dimensions`,
`project` or `cost_center` on a report that does not document them is
`400 VALIDATION_ERROR`. Any other query parameter a report does not document
is not applied, and the response names it in the `X-Ignored-Query-Params`
header: check that header when a filter seems to have had no effect.

**Async operations.** Long-running actions (fiscal-period lock/close/year-end,
imports) return `202` with an operation id; poll `GET /api/v1/operations/{id}`
until `status` is `succeeded`/`failed`. The response shape is identical
whether the work ran inline or queued.

**Versioning.** Dated versions (current: see `meta.api_version`). Responses
carry the `Gnubok-Version` header; request pinning via a `Gnubok-Version`
request header is reserved for a future breaking change and is not read
today. Additive changes ship without a version bump; see
https://app.gnubok.se/docs/api/versioning.

**Index badges.** Every operation line below carries machine-readable
annotations from the spec: `scope:` (required key scope), `risk:` (low/medium/
high; confirm with a human before unprompted high-risk calls), `idempotent`
(safe to retry), `dry-run` (previewable), `reversible` (a single follow-up
call can undo it, e.g. invoice credit).

## Gotchas (Swedish accounting domain)

Rules a generic REST integration will violate unless told:

- **Account numbers are strings, not numbers.** BAS accounts (`"1930"`,
  `"3001"`) are identifiers; send them as JSON strings. Arithmetic on them,
  zero-stripping, or number coercion corrupts postings.
- **Posted journal entries are immutable by law** (Bokföringslagen). There is
  no PATCH or DELETE on a committed entry, ever. Undo with
  `POST .../journal-entries/{id}/reverse` (storno), fix with
  `POST .../journal-entries/{id}/correct`. Design flows around
  reverse-and-repost, not edit-in-place.
- **Voucher numbers are gapless and server-assigned.** Never assume or
  pre-allocate one; read it from `meta.audit.voucher_number` after commit. A
  legally required gap explanation goes through
  `POST .../voucher-gap-explanations`.
- **Every entry balances.** `sum(debit) === sum(credit)` to the öre, amounts
  are decimal SEK numbers (max 2 decimals). Do rounding with
  round-half-away-from-zero on öre; never float-accumulate line totals
  client-side and "fix" the difference on a random line.
- **Period locks are a feature, not an error to retry.** Writes into a
  locked/closed period return `PERIOD_LOCKED` (with `valid_alternatives`
  pointing at open periods). Retrying the same request cannot succeed; either
  target an open period or surface the lock to the user.
- **Drafts vs posted.** Invoices are created as drafts with
  `invoice_number: null`; the F-series number is assigned atomically on send.
  Journal entries follow draft -> commit. Nothing financial exists in the
  ledger until the commit/send action.
- **Two invoice worlds.** `invoices` = accounts receivable (you bill
  customers); `supplier-invoices` = accounts payable (you receive bills).
  They are different resources with different lifecycles.
- **Swedish user-facing text.** `error.message` is Swedish by design; show it
  to Swedish end users, and use `message_en` for your own logs/logic. Domain
  terms in responses (moms, verifikat, kostnadsställe) are not translatable
  labels but legal concepts.
- **Compliance pre-flight.** Before building your own validation for Swedish
  rules, call `GET .../compliance/check`: it runs the server's own rule set
  (VAT plausibility, sequence integrity, period status) and returns findings.

## Verification

This skill is generated (`npm run apiskill:generate` in the Accounted repo)
from the same endpoint registry that serves the live API, its OpenAPI spec
(`https://app.gnubok.se/api/v1/openapi.json`), and its runtime request
validators, so schema drift between this text and the server cannot occur for
a matching `api_version`. CI regenerates and diffs it on every change.

Before first use in a new environment, smoke-test:

```bash
curl -s https://app.gnubok.se/api/v1/health
curl -s https://app.gnubok.se/api/v1/companies -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCOUNTED_API_KEY"
```

If `meta.api_version` in responses is newer than the version in this skill's
index header, refetch the skill (or read the changelog at
https://app.gnubok.se/docs/api/changelog) before relying on endpoint details.
