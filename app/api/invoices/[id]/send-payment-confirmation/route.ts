 * POST /api/invoices/[id]/send-payment-confirmation (#1693)
 *
 * Emails the customer a betalningsbekräftelse: the paid re-render of the
 * faktura (BETALD stamp, "Betalt / Att betala: 0") attached to a short
 * confirmation mail. Same email service, recipients and branding as the
 * invoice send, but deliberately none of its side effects: the invoice
 * status, sent_at, journal entries and the delivery history are untouched.
 * The delivery history records what was sent as the invoice, and a later
 * confirmation must never be mistaken for that file, so this route logs the
 * send and writes nothing to the database.
