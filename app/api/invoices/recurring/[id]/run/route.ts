/**
 * POST /api/invoices/recurring/[id]/run: manually generate (and, when the
 * schedule has auto_send, email) an invoice from a recurring schedule right
 * now, on demand.
 *
 * Why this exists: the cron never sends for a past date, and all schedules
 * were paused on the send-time rollout, so a user who wants this month's
 * invoice sent now needs an explicit, conscious action. This is that action.
 * It runs regardless of status (active or paused): the user is clicking the
 * button themselves, so awareness is not in question.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT touch next_run_date: a manual send is out-of-band
 * and must not disturb the monthly cadence.
