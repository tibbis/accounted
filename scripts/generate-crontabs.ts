/**
 * Crontab generator: emits docker/crontab.hosted and docker/crontab.self-hosted
 * from the `crons` array in vercel.json.
 *
 * vercel.json is the single source of truth for what runs on a schedule. The
 * Docker deployments run the same HTTP endpoints through supercronic, so their
 * crontabs are generated from that array instead of hand-maintained.
 *
 * Hand-maintaining them is exactly what went wrong: seven of sixteen jobs were
 * missing from Docker entirely (recurring invoices never sent, webhooks never
 * dispatched, idempotency_keys grew unbounded), /api/tax-deadlines/cron had
 * degraded from daily to "0 0 2 1 *" (once a year, on 2 January), and
 * /api/documents/verify/cron ran weekly against a daily vercel.json.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/generate-crontabs.ts   # rewrite both crontabs
 *   npm run crontabs:generate              # same, via package.json
 *
 * scripts/__tests__/generate-crontabs.test.ts fails CI if the committed files
 * drift from vercel.json again.

 *
 * Empty, and that is the reviewed answer rather than an oversight:
 *
 *  - Extension endpoints stay in, including extensions the self-hosted preset
 *    does not enable. docker/extensions.self-hosted.json turns on eight
 *    extensions, but the preset only drives the runtime registry: the
 *    Dockerfile builds the whole app/ tree, so every extension cron route is
 *    compiled into the image either way. And every one of them answers HTTP
 *    200 with a no-op body when its extension is unconfigured (skatteverket
 *    checks SKATTEVERKET_ENABLED, stripe checks STRIPE_SECRET_KEY plus
 *    STRIPE_CONNECT_CLIENT_ID, cloud-backup and enable-banking simply find no
 *    rows). An unused extension therefore costs one cheap request at its
 *    cadence, and a self-hoster who enables it later does not have to discover
 *    that the schedule was never there. This also matches the pre-existing
 *    intent: the hand-written crontabs already listed enable-banking and
 *    skattekonto, both of which are now in the self-hosted preset (unconfigured extensions no-op).
 *  - /api/sandbox/cleanup/cron stays in. The sandbox is a database flag
 *    (company_settings.is_sandbox), not a hosted-only build flag, and the
 *    cleanup_expired_sandbox_users RPC ships in supabase/migrations
 *    (20260311120000_sandbox_support.sql), so a self-hosted database has it.
 *    With no sandbox users it deletes 0 rows and returns 200.

 *
 * Empty on both variants: every job currently runs the vercel.json cadence
 * everywhere. Two candidates were considered and rejected:
 *
 *  - /api/documents/verify/cron ran weekly ("0 3 * * 0") in the hand-written
 *    crontabs against a daily vercel.json. Not a load concession: the run is
 *    capped at 200 documents (DOCUMENT_VERIFY_BATCH_SIZE) and walks a
 *    nulls-first queue, so weekly drains the WORM integrity queue seven times
 *    slower on a check that exists to satisfy BFL 7-year retention. The weekly
 *    cadence also sat in crontab.hosted, which is not a small box (the two
 *    files were byte-identical), so it cannot have been a self-hosted
 *    concession. Treated as drift and realigned to daily.
 *  - /api/webhooks/dispatch/cron at "* * * * *" is 1440 requests/day that
 *    self-hosted was not making before. Left at parity anyway: the retry
 *    ladder in lib/webhooks/dispatcher.ts opens with a 60-second first retry,
 *    which a coarser tick would silently stretch, and each tick is one indexed
 *    query that returns immediately when nothing is due. See the load note in
