/**
 * Ratchet guard against post-audit antipatterns.
 *
 * The audit found two repository-wide problems that are being remediated in
 * dedicated campaigns (A1 = route auth/MFA, D1 = money rounding). Those touch
 * hundreds of sites and won't land in one PR: so this guard makes sure the
 * count can only go DOWN, never up, while the migrations are in flight.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   1. raw-route-auth : an `app/api/**\/route.ts` that calls
 *      `supabase.auth.getUser()` directly instead of going through
 *      `requireAuth()` / `withRouteContext()` (the only guards that enforce
 *      MFA AAL2 on hosted). Judged per exported handler, not per file: a
 *      wrapped PATCH next to a hand-rolled DELETE in the same file is still
 *      a violation (that exact shape hid two MFA bypasses until 2026-08-26).
 *      Tracked as a file-set so a NEW offending route fails CI even if an
 *      old one was fixed in the same PR.
 *   2. naive-ore-round: `Math.round(x * 100) / 100`, which is subtly wrong on
 *      exact-half values (see lib/money.ts `roundOre`). Tracked as a count.
 *      The canonical rounding modules are excluded.
 *   3. direct-jel-insert: a file that inserts into `journal_entry_lines`
 *      outside the sanctioned writers. During the dimensions dual-write window
 *      every line writer must derive cost_center/project via
 *      lineDimensionColumns() from the dimensions JSONB map
 *      (lib/bookkeeping/dimension-resolver.ts): a new direct insert site can
 *      silently diverge the mirror columns. Tracked as a file-set.
 *   3b. ledger-scanning-report: a statement generator under lib/reports or
 *      lib/bokslut that aggregates `journal_entry_lines` itself instead of
 *      going through generateTrialBalance. Aggregating raw lines means
 *      remembering, per report, that the resultatavslut posts the mirror image
 *      of every P&L account into 2099 inside the same fiscal period. Three
 *      reports forgot (årsredovisning 2026-07-23, INK2R and NE-bilaga
 *      2026-07-29) and each read ZERO revenue for a closed year while the
 *      balance sheet still tied out, so nothing warned. generateTrialBalance
 *      now requires an explicit closingEntry mode, which turns the decision
 *      into a compile error; this guard keeps new reports on that path.
 *      Tracked as a file-set. Voucher/line LISTINGS are sanctioned in
 *      LEDGER_SCAN_SANCTIONED: they have no closingEntry decision to make.
 *   3c. direct-invoice-payment-insert: a file that inserts into
 *      `invoice_payments` outside lib/invoices/invoice-payment-row.ts. Five
 *      hand-built inserts each computed their own `amount`, and the bank-match
 *      ones stored the cash received instead of the amount applied to the
 *      invoice, so a whole-krona overshoot absorbed on 3740 made the row
 *      exceed the receivable (#2250). recordInvoicePaymentRow() is the one
 *      writer. Tracked as a file-set, no baseline: the count is 0 today.
 *   4. pinned-dep    : a dependency pinned to an exact version (PINNED_DEPS)
 *      whose package.json spec or locked version drifted from the pin. Guards
 *      against a repeat of the @anthropic-ai/bedrock-sdk 0.32.0 prod outage
 *      (empty Bedrock stream). No baseline: any drift is a hard failure.
 *   5. raw-user-error: raw caught-error messages passed to API response fields,
 *      client error state, or toast fields. Engine, database, and upstream
 *      messages must pass through getErrorMessage() or errorResponse().
 *   6. sek-labelled-amount: a single-argument formatCurrency() call on a value
 *      read off a record the same file reads `.currency` from, which prints a
 *      foreign amount with the SEK symbol. Implementation and rationale in
 *      format-currency-sek-label.mjs. No baseline: the count is 0 today.
 *   7. extension-route guards: physical routes under app/api/extensions/<id>/
 *      (the sanctioned core-build carve-out for crons/OAuth callbacks) may
 *      only import their OWN extension (hard fail, 0 today) and must gate on
 *      extensionRegistry.get('<id>') so a disabled extension never exposes a
 *      live surface (allowlisted file-set, may only shrink). Implementation
 *      and rationale in extension-route-guards.mjs.
 *   8. hand-rolled-invariant: a shared format rule (BAS account number, ISO
 *      date, four-digit fiscal year) spelled out inline instead of imported
 *      from lib/invariants/. The BAS account rule was written out at 20 sites
 *      and the ISO date rule at 68, with error messages that differed per site;
 *      the four Skatteverket-bound org-number paths disagreed outright about
 *      what "valid" meant, which is the kind of drift a customer only discovers
 *      when a filing fails at the deadline. Tracked as a count.
 *   9. leaky-supabase-client: server code importing supabase-js's `createClient`
 *      as a value instead of `createServiceRoleClient()`. The default
 *      `autoRefreshToken: true` starts a 30 s setInterval that is never
 *      cleared; `unref()` keeps the process exitable but not the timer
 *      collectable, so each constructed client retains its whole request scope.
 *      Killed a self-hosted instance after 42 idle hours (2026-08-13). No
 *      baseline: the count is 0 today.
 *   10. off-ladder-radius: a border-radius class outside the locked ladder
 *      (pill / rounded-xl overlays / rounded-lg surfaces / rounded-sm leaves;
 *      see .claude/rules/design.md). Before the 2026-08 migration the UI had
 *      seven radii in circulation (4/5/6/8/12/16px + pill) and one toolbar row
 *      could mix four of them. `rounded-md`, bare `rounded`, `rounded-2xl`+
 *      and arbitrary `rounded-[Npx]` are dead vocabulary in app/ and
 *      components/. No baseline: the count is 0, any new one is a hard
 *      failure.
 *  10. folded-public-flag: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_X === 'true'` compared in
 *      place. The Docker image bakes sentinels that docker-entrypoint.sh
 *      substitutes at container start; an in-place comparison is constant-
 *      folded and dead-code-eliminated at build time, erasing both the name
 *      and the sentinel, so the flag is permanently false however the operator
 *      configures it. Every Docker self-host consequently ran with the
 *      entitlement paywall live (diagnosed 2026-08-17). Read flags as values
 *      via lib/env/public-flags. No baseline: the count is 0, any new one is
 *      a hard failure.
 *   11. dialog-overflow-risk: patterns that make a dialog scroll sideways.
 *      (a) a bare `1fr` grid track inside grid-cols-[...] in a file that
 *      imports DialogContent/SheetContent: per the CSS Grid spec a bare fr
 *      track's implicit minimum is auto (its content's min-content size), so
 *      the track refuses to shrink below its content and overflows the dialog
 *      (StrikeLinesDialog and CorrectionEntryDialog shipped this, fixed
 *      2026-08-19; TransactionBookingDialog had the safe minmax(0,1fr) idiom
 *      all along). (b) whitespace-nowrap inside a <DialogContent>/
 *      <SheetContent> JSX region outside DIALOG_NOWRAP_ALLOWED (numeric
 *      columns inside their own overflow-x-auto wrapper are fine and
 *      allowlisted per file). (c) a hand-rolled absolute overlay forcing
 *      min-w-[>=20rem] in a file that never portals anything to
 *      document.body: DialogContent's overflow-y-auto computes overflow-x to
 *      auto as well, so an oversized non-portaled panel grows the dialog a
 *      horizontal scrollbar instead of repositioning (AccountCombobox's
 *      dropdown pre-2026-08-19). Tracked as a per-file baseline set that may
 *      only shrink.
 *   12. ambiguous-embed: a PostgREST `.select()` that embeds a table joined to
 *      the from-table by more than one foreign key, without naming the
 *      relationship. PostgREST answers PGRST201 instead of picking one, and
 *      neither a mocked-Supabase unit test (a mock never resolves a
 *      relationship) nor a pg-real test (it bypasses PostgREST) can see that,
 *      so a static guard is the only thing that catches the class. Two sites
 *      shipped the same journal_entries -> fiscal_periods embed: the nightly
 *      underlag cron (fixed 2026-08-31, ~60 period-lock trigger rejections a
 *      night) and supplier-invoice underlag anchoring, which swallowed the
 *      error and therefore never anchored a single document in production.
 *      The ambiguous pairs are derived from supabase/migrations; both hint
 *      forms PostgREST accepts count as disambiguated. Implementation and
 *      rationale in ambiguous-embed.mjs. No baseline: the count is 0 today.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/checks/no-new-antipatterns.mjs            # check (CI)
 *  11. direct-ai-client: a file outside lib/ai that imports createAiClient,
 *      calls `.messages.create/stream(` on an Anthropic client, or imports
 *      the Vercel AI SDK. Every model call goes through getAiService() so the
 *      backend (Bedrock on hosted, a Swedish OpenAI-compatible endpoint on a
 *      sovereign self-host) stays an environment decision. Allowlist of the
 *      pre-abstraction call sites in this file, may only shrink.
 *
 *   node scripts/checks/no-new-antipatterns.mjs --update   # re-baseline after a migration ratchets the count down
 *
 * Exit code 1 if either check regressed past its baseline.
