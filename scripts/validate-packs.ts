/**
 * CI gate for the konteringspaket catalogue.
 *
 * Schema validation alone is not enough. The failure this whole format exists
 * to prevent (PR #1321: seeded reference data that contradicted what the engine
 * actually books) passes any structural check: the JSON was well-formed, the
 * account numbers were four digits, and the values were still wrong. So the
 * gate also asserts the things that make a pack *correct*:
 *
 *   1. Schema (lib/packs/schema.ts), including the vat_rate / ratio split.
 *   2. Filename equals meta.slug: the slug is the public lookup key.
 *   3. Slugs and meta.order are unique. Order is the single source of truth for
 *      display order in both the gallery and the docs, so a duplicate makes the
 *      two surfaces disagree non-deterministically.
 *   4. Every account exists in the BAS 2026 reference chart. This is the #1321
 *      check.
 *   5. The pack BALANCES when applied, using the real applyTemplate() rather
 *      than a reimplementation, so the validator tests what the product does.
 *   6. Debit and credit are both present: a template posting only one side can
 *      never produce a legal verifikat.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/validate-packs.ts          # validate (CI)
 *   npx tsx scripts/validate-packs.ts --json   # machine-readable summary
