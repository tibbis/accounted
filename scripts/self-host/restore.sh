# Accounted self-host restore: the counterpart of backup.sh.
#
# Restores one backup set (database dump, ACL manifest, optional storage
# archive, optional db-config archive) from the S3-compatible bucket into a
# target Postgres and storage directory. Destructive by design: it drops and
# recreates the objects in the target database (--clean). Run it against a
# FRESH Supabase stack, or one you are prepared to overwrite, and pass --yes.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/self-host/restore.sh <backup-name> --yes
#     e.g. scripts/self-host/restore.sh nightly-20260820T020000Z --yes
#
# Environment:
#   RESTORE_DATABASE_URL     target postgresql://... (required unless
#                            RESTORE_SKIP_DATABASE=1). Connect as the stack's
#                            `postgres` role, the one the migrations ran as.
#   BACKUP_S3_ENDPOINT, BACKUP_S3_BUCKET, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
#   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, BACKUP_S3_REGION, BACKUP_S3_PREFIX   as in backup.sh
#   RESTORE_STORAGE_DIR      optional: where to unpack the storage archive
#                            (the new stack's <supabase-dir>/volumes/storage).
#   RESTORE_DB_CONFIG_VOLUME optional: Docker volume name to unpack the
#                            db-config archive into. The database container
#                            must be STOPPED for this and started afterwards,
#                            so do it as its own pass with
#                            RESTORE_SKIP_DATABASE=1 (see the runbook).
#   RESTORE_SKIP_DATABASE    optional: set to 1 to skip pg_restore and the ACL
#                            check (the db-config pass above).
#   RESTORE_WORKDIR          optional scratch dir.
#   RESTORE_TOLERATE_ERRORS  optional: set to 1 to continue when pg_restore
#                            reports errors (exit status 1). Default is to
#                            STOP before the ACL check and storage and show
#                            the error log. On a Supabase target these
#                            classes are routine (the stack already owns and
#                            grants those objects; the restoring role is not a
#                            superuser): "already exists"; "does not exist"
#                            from DROP ... IF EXISTS of policies/triggers on
#                            a fresh target; "must be member of role
#                            supabase_*", "must be owner of ...", "permission
#                            denied ..." and "grant options cannot be granted
#                            back" on GRANT/REVOKE/ALTER for objects in
#                            auth, storage, realtime, extensions, cron, vault,
#                            graphql*, pgbouncer. Errors on public.* objects
#                            are NOT expected: investigate before continuing.
#                            A partial restore must be a decision you take
#                            knowingly, not a default.
#
# Order that works: (1) bring up a fresh Supabase stack with the SAME
# JWT_SECRET / ANON_KEY / SERVICE_ROLE_KEY as the old one (or re-issue keys to
# your Accounted .env), (2) stop the database container and restore db-config
# (RESTORE_DB_CONFIG_VOLUME + RESTORE_SKIP_DATABASE=1), (3) start it and
# restore the database and storage (second run), (4) restart storage-api,
# (5) run `scripts/smoke-ai-provider.ts`-style checks and log in.
